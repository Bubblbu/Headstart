Reviewing literature and/or ProMED mailings in reverse chronological order, we found following reports from the Mumbai region: 1. Pooja R Murphy et al described recently (2016) a fatal case of IgM-confirmed acute hantavirus infection in a 30-year-old female, admitted at the Holy Family Hospital, Mumbai. She developed in her post-partum multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), needing both dialysis and ventilatory support for extreme O2 desaturation (PaO2/Fi O2 less than 100) from bilateral, rapidly progressive lung infiltrates. Tests for malaria, dengue and leptospirosis were negative [1]. 2. A 39-year-old man was admitted at private hospital of Ghathopar (greater Mumbai) in 2015 for increasing dyspnoea after being bitten by a rat. After 10 days of non-invasive ventilatory support, he could be discharged from the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Serologic test were positive for a hantavirus infection. The consulted Bombay Medical College (BMC) reported at least 2 other hantavirus cases in Mumbai, in 2006 and in 2010 [2]. 3. A 21-year-old female was admitted at Chembur Hospital, Mumbai, in 2010 for fever, severe gastro-intestinal symptoms and critical dyspnoea. A private laboratory found 'blood samples positive for hantavirus'. After 7 days in ICU and 3 days in a hospital ward, she could be discharged [3]. 4. Salil Mehta and Prakash Jiandani described in 2007 a total of 5 hantavirus IgM-positive cases, all admitted for MODS with acute kidney injury (AKI), dyspnoea with bilateral lung infiltrates, and hemorrhagic complications, but spontaneously remitting within a week [4]. This total count, non-detailed cases included, is thus at least 10 serologically confirmed prior cases from the Mumbai region. For all these prior cases however, including the current 11th pediatric and fatal case in Mumbai, the exact infecting hantaviral pathogen was hitherto never specified, as justly remarked again by the current moderator TY. From a clinical point of view however, and with this other, clinically well-documented, fatal case in a Mumbai hospital [1], we can now readily confirm that a hantaviral agent was and is active in India, causing sometimes fatal 'hantavirus pulmonary syndrome' (HPS), or at least acute lung injury (ALI), combined to AKI [acute kidney injury], which is mostly coined in literature as 'hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome' (HFRS). Regrettably, details concerning the level and serotype of the IgM-positive serology were again not given. Of note, the 5 former Mumbai 2007 cases [4], had all spontaneously remitting MODS, thereby resembling the mostly milder European, Puumala virus (PUUV)-induced forms with lung involvement, described already since 1994 [5]. Indeed, rapidly developing (and sometimes fatal) non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema with evanescent bilateral lung infiltrates on RX chest and pronounced O2 desaturation, should not longer be automatically classified as the 'American form of hantavirus disease', since similar, sometimes serious, lung involvement has also been described in European, PUUV-induced forms [6] [7]. Recently, a very severe PUUV-induced 'HPS' form in a German case needed even extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), combined with dialysis, as life-saving ICU procedures, considered hitherto as mandatory only in some critical American HPS cases [8]. Perhaps now the time is ripe to accept also the existence of an Asian 'HPS' form as well, prevalent in the Indian subcontinent, and maybe genetically related to the arvicoline PUUV agent, or the sigmodontine Sin Nombre virus (SNV) or Andes virus (ANDV) forms? However, the 5 Mumbai cases [4] presented also overt hemorrhagic manifestations, including hematuria, hematemesis, melena or bleeding gums, symptoms which are rare in South-American ANDV cases, exceptional in PUUV cases, and almost non-existent in North-American SNV infections. Moreover, the simultaneous occurrence of serious hemorrhages with 'HPS' is a rare clinical combination in all hantavirus infections, except perhaps for some rare Dobrava virus (DOBV) infections, which are absent in India. Apart from unanswered clinical questions, the main enigma remains of course the viral origin, more than 10 years after the 1st report of fatal Indian hantavirus cases, presenting with 'HPS' and 'HFRS' [9]. Surprisingly, both these fatal cases, one from Cochin and another from Chennai, yielded IgM and IgG positive results in ELISA and in more specific strip immunoassay (SIA) [9]. Negative results were obtained however with primers specific for most of the then known hantaviral pathogens, being PUUV, Seoul virus (SEOV), DOBV, ANDV, and the Korean prototype Hantaan virus (HTNV). Moreover, we also performed RT-PCR for Thottapalayam virus (TPMV), a shrew-borne hantavirus autochthonous to India, which was equally negative [10]. In their 2007 publication [4], the Indian authors found increasing IgM OD values in repeated screening with a commercial ELISA IgM kit (Focus Technologies, Cypress, CA, USA), containing 5 different hantaviral antigens, being HTNV, SEOV, PUUV, DOBV, and SNV. Regrettably, the highest obtained OD values were not mentioned, but it should be noted that for these 5 hantaviral pathogens, the only rodent carrier with an established presence in India, is the wild rat (_Rattus rattus_), spreading SEOV. However, another murine pathogen, Thailand virus (THAIV), can give extensive serological cross-reactions with SEOV, and the THAIV rodent carrier, the bandicoot rat (_Bandicota indica_), is likewise present throughout most of the Indian subcontinent. In a retrospective study on 9 serum samples of non-acute patients, selected as being ELISA IgG-positive with the same commercial Focus Technologies kit, S Chandy et al found 2 sera subsequently clearly reacting with THAIV truncated nucleocapsid proteins (NP), but none with PUUV NP [11]. Finally, and in 2009, S Chandy et al reported, a typical HFRS case without lung involvement in Cudappah, Andhra Pradesh, confirmed as being hantavirus-induced by positive ELISA IgM and IgG with the same commercial Focus Technologies kit, and confirmed by IFA with HTNV. RT-PCR however was again negative [12]. The prototype Korean HTNV, in hantavirus pioneer times long time used as sole screening antigen, is known for its beneficial potential to pick up non-homologous infecting hantaviral serotypes, but a true HTNV infection is to be excluded here, since the rodent HTNV carrier, the striped field mouse (_Apodemus agrarius_), is absent from India. However, an acute infection by other murine pathogens such as SEOV or THAIV is distinctly possible. As for the current fatal 12-year-old hantavirus case, we agree with the moderator that further results, expected from the consulted National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune, would be of utmost interest, since once again the exact or putative hantaviral pathogen was not specified in the 'positive results', apparently delivered by a private laboratory. We also agree with the moderator that confusion subsists as to the question if (concomitant?) leptospirosis played a role in the fatal outcome. Profuse bleeding from the lungs is suggestive for leptospirosis, rather than for hantaviral acute non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, characterized by bilateral, but evanescent lung infiltrates on RX chest. Moreover, both ELISA and MAT testing for leptospirosis can remain false-negative during the 1st days after infection. Thus, dual concomitant leptospirosis-hantavirus infection is a (often underestimated) possibility, as shown in Sri Lanka [13], a country highly endemic for leptospirosis, and even in Belgium [14], where the leptospirosis prevalence is very low. In summary, there is now since more than 10 years mounting clinical and serological evidence of 'HPS' and/or 'HFRS' prevalent in India, but still without any conclusive biomolecular proof so far of the exact etiologic hantaviral agent(s). SEOV, THAIV, and possibly a PUUV-like novel agent are possible contenders. The authors of this ProMED mail contacted several times, and since years, all cited Indian and Sri Lankan authors for obtaining more fresh serum samples of suspected clinical cases from their respective centers, however without success so far. Without clear knowledge concerning the involved hantavirus virus species and their rodent (or insectivore?) carriers, prevalent in India, preventive measures will remain futile, and consequently, further morbidity and even fatality rates from this emerging infection will probably remain unaltered in this subcontinent.

The first case was detected on Wednesday [19 Oct 2016] in a janitorial employee of the Nephrology department of this medical center and then 5 other cases have been diagnosed among nursing professionals. The SATSE union argues that the source of this outbreak could be a patient who had gone undiagnosed with the disease. After recording 6 cases, the hospital Prevention Service has sent a circular to workers with a series of tips to prevent the spread and people who already had symptoms have been treated. SATSE explained that scabies is a mild infectious disease that requires a non-aggressive treatment, because with the daily application of a cream and enough protection, symptoms improve or even disappear. Scabies is spread by indirect contact through sheets or clothing, or by direct contact, although in the case of health professionals the latter possibility is less likely because they work with gloves. The same sources have indicated that it is sometimes difficult to detect because this skin condition is often misdiagnosed as eczema or dermatitis, hence there may be more cases diagnosed in the coming days. SATSE considers it should be investigated whether the hospital 'has acted right or wrong', for which they should determine the time that has passed since the first diagnosis to the time prevention and treatment were launched. -- Communicated by: ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts [Although rare, outbreaks in institutions are well known. Scabies occur worldwide from arctic to tropical areas and are a well known disease of poverty and poor hygiene. Scabies can be treated by ointments containing pyrethroids which are rubbed all over the body. Thorough washing of clothes and bed linen is vital to stop transmission. An alternative treatment is the use of 2 oral doses of Ivermectin, 200 microgram per kg body weight one week apart. Ivermectin has few side effects and can be given to both staff and patients. - Mod.EP A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: .] [See Also: 2011 -- Scabies, nursing home - Spain: (La Rioja): 20111231.3716 Scabies, hospital acquired - Spain (Canary Islands)] .................................................sb/ep/ao/mpp",Scabies,"Huelva, Andalusia, Spain",37.258331,-6.950833,Humans

4581706,PRO/AH/EDR> Contaminated marijuana - USA: (OR) pesticide,2016-10-24 21:06:33,"CONTAMINATED MARIJUANA - USA: (OREGON) PESTICIDE ************************************************ A ProMED-mail post ProMED-mail is a program of the International Society for Infectious Diseases Date: 23 Oct 2016 Source: Outbreak News Today [edited] The Oregon Health Authority (OHA) is issuing a health alert regarding marijuana products that may have been tainted with high levels of a pesticide and sold to about 130 people in the McMinnville area. The alert concerns dried flower marijuana that New Leaf, a medical marijuana dispensary located at 3325 NE Riverside Drive in McMinnville, sold under the strain names Dr. Jack, batch number G6J0051-02, and Marion Berry, batch number G6J0051-01. The products were sold to about 130 recreational and medical marijuana customers between 17-19 Oct 2016 and came from batches that failed a pesticide test because they contained high levels of a chemical known as spinosad. Anyone who visited the dispensary during this time frame should check the label of the product they purchased and immediately return any of the tainted product to the dispensary, or dispose of it in a safe and responsible manner. The OHA 'action level' for spinosad is 0.2 parts per million (ppm). The batches of Dr. Jack and Marion Berry contained 42 and 22 ppm, respectively. Effects of smoking marijuana containing spinosad are not known. Those concerned about exposure to spinosad or who are experiencing health problems after using affected marijuana strains should contact the Oregon Poison Center at 800-222-1222. 'There is no level of spinosad that has been shown to be safe in cannabis that is smoked,' says David Farrer, Ph.D., a public health toxicologist with OHA. 'Our action levels serve as a pre-market screen, but should not be considered 'safe levels.'' EPA has established health-based levels of spinosad that are allowed on food products. However, these 'tolerances,' as they are called, have not been developed for cannabis and assume that the product will be swallowed as opposed to smoked [If made into marijuana butter or brownies, then it would be swallowed vs. smoked. - Mod.TG]. The tainted batches were transferred to the dispensary by a McMinnville grower that had the marijuana tested by an accredited and licensed cannabis testing laboratory. The affected strains came from just the one grower and were transferred only to New Leaf. Strains with similar names sold at other dispensaries are not believed to have been affected. OHA is not naming the grower because that information is confidential under Oregon law. OHA officials are investigating why the batches were transferred from the grower to the dispensary and then sold by the dispensary to customers, as the products were transferred with failed test results. If a marijuana item fails a pesticide test and a re-test, the batch from which samples were taken must be destroyed. More information about cannabis testing can be found on the OHA website. OHA offers the following tips to consumers considering purchasing marijuana products: Read marijuana product labels. All labels must have the producer's business or trade name and licensee or registrant number; the business or trade name of licensee or registrant that packaged or distributed the product, if different from the producer; the name of the strain; and the universal symbol. Request a copy of the pesticide test results from the dispensary. People choosing to smoke marijuana should consider the negative effects that smoking may have on their health. According to the National Pesticide Information Center (NPIC) at Oregon State University, spinosad is a natural substance made by a soil bacterium that can be toxic to insects. It is used to control such pests as thrips, leaf miners, spider mites, mosquitoes, ants and fruit flies. NPIC also notes that spinosad is low in toxicity to people and other mammals, but it can cause irritation and redness if it gets on your skin or in your eyes. The effects of smoking a product contaminated with spinosad are unknown. -- Communicated by: ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts [Spinosad is a natural substance made by a soil bacterium that can be toxic to insects. It is a mixture of 2 chemicals called spinosyn A and spinosyn D. It is used to control a wide variety of pests. These include thrips, leafminers, spider mites, mosquitoes, ants, fruit flies and others. Given that it is active against these various pests, there may have been a presumed legitimate reason for the plants to have been sprayed with the product. Spinosad is used for other pests such as fleas, ticks and flies in cattle, dogs and cats. Currently, spinosad is found in over 80 registered pesticide products. Many of these are used on agricultural crops and ornamental plants. Others are used in and around buildings, in aquatic settings, and as seed treatments. These products are commonly sprays, dusts, granules, and pellets. Some of these products are approved for use in organic agriculture. Spinosad is also found in some drugs regulated by the US Food and Drug Administration. These products are used to control head lice on people and fleas on dogs and cats. Spinosad affects the nervous system of insects that eat or touch it. It causes their muscles to flex uncontrollably. This leads to paralysis and ultimately their death, typically within 1-2 days. People are most commonly exposed to very low levels of spinosad through their diet. Exposure can also occur if you breathe it in or get it on your skin or eyes. For example, this can occur while applying sprays or dusts during windy conditions. This can also happen after using a product if you don't wash your hands before eating or smoking. You can limit your exposure and reduce the risk by carefully following the label instructions. Spinosad is low in toxicity to people and other mammals. However, if it gets on your skin or in your eyes it can cause irritation and redness. In one study, 28 dogs were fed low to moderate doses of spinosad. One dog that received a moderate dose vomited. No effects related to spinosad were observed in the other dogs. When eaten, spinosad is readily absorbed. Once inside it moves to many areas of the body and is broken down. The majority leaves the body in feces or urine within 1-2 days. Spinosad is absorbed poorly through skin contact. So while there may be no precedent for the chemical being inhaled, we do know that if the marijuana is ingested (such as in Alice B. Toklas brownies - Mod.MPP) that it is readily absorbed. We know the melting point and the vapor pressure of the product, but not whether it is broken down or absorbed when smoked.

These included 5 at the deer park in south Delhi's Hauz Khas, which has been closed to visitors. Two more birds also died at the zoo, which has been shut since Tuesday [18 Oct 2016] following confirmation of 3 H5N8, or avian flu, deaths. Samples of 6-7 other birds that died earlier have been sent for testing. Elsewhere, 3 crows were found dead in Sundar Nagar, less than one km from the zoo, and at least one bird death was reported from Asola Bhatti sanctuary in Tughlaqabad, a known nesting site for migratory birds. Delhi development minister Gopal Rai said 3 ducks were found dead at the same spot in the deer park, and 2 more migratory birds died on Thursday [20 Oct 2016], raising suspicion that the deaths could have been caused by bird flu. 'We've asked for the park to be closed indefinitely and to find out whether more deaths are taking place,' he said. Rai reiterated that there was no need for panic. 'But people should be alert about birds dying in their localities. One should not venture near bird carcasses and immediately report any death to the helpline (011-23890318) being run by the state,' the minister said. Sources in the animal husbandry department said the deaths of 3 crows in Sunder Nagar raise suspicions about the disease spreading beyond the zoo and sanctuaries and infecting indigenous birds, but any alert on this would be issued only after test results come in. All leaves of animal husbandry staff have been cancelled in view of the emerging situation. The Delhi government is sending samples of all dead birds to a Jalandhar-based lab for confirmation of bird flu. 'We have constituted 10 rapid response teams besides forming a 23-member team headed by development commissioner Sandeep Kumar for better coordination between departments. Apart from this, 10 municipal corporation teams have been kept in reserve for any crisis. Civic bodies have been asked to maintain cleanliness at dump yards near chicken and poultry farms,' said a senior official. He added that chicken wholesale markets and poultry farms have been asked to report any dead birds and keep their area clean. Bird flu is rare among humans and, experts say, India has not reported a single such case as yet. But state health officials said there was no room for complacency. [There have not been any reports of human cases of influenza A H5N8 to date globally. - Mod.MPP] 'We have sufficient stocks of Tamiflu, which is used for treating bird flu in humans. Advisories will be issued to the public,' an official said. He said that at present there was no ban on eating cooked chicken or other poultry, but those handling them in the abattoir or at shops should take precautions. Globally, 856 cases of bird flu were reported in humans between 2003 and 2016. Out of these, 452 died, reflecting the high mortality rate of the disease. Initial symptoms of bird flu in humans include high fever, sore throat, abdominal pain, chest pain and diarrhoea. But patients can develop severe symptoms such as respiratory distress and pneumonia, leading to death. Rai said many migratory birds come to Delhi from neighbouring states. 'A portion of the Asola Bhatti wildlife sanctuary, for example, falls under Haryana. We are trying to involve officials from that state to intensify the identification of bird deaths,' he added. -- Communicated by: ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts [After the emergence and spread of HPAI H5N1 in Asia in 1996, a new lineage of HPAI virus (H5N8) emerged and persisted.

The local health unit has offered antibiotic prophylaxis to all possible contacts. The case is particularly worrying because the young man had been recently vaccinated against _N. meningitis_ type C in the campaign set up by the Tuscany Region in an effort to curb the meningitis morbidity peak, which reached 31 cases in 2015 and 23 so far in 2016. The present case is the 10th that has occurred in vaccinated people, which raises doubts on the protective efficacy of the vaccine. [La Repubblica also reported that] Rino Rappuoli, credited as the developer of the conjugated vaccine, pointed out in an interview with the newspaper that 7 of the 10 cases had been vaccinated more than 5 years earlier and suggested that a recall could be advisable every 5 years [2]. [1. La Repubblica, 21 Oct 2016 (in Italian, translated by Pasquale Urbano, edited): . 2. La Repubblica, 22 Oct 2016 (in Italian, translated by Pasquale Urbano, edited): .] -- Prof. Pasquale Urbano University of Florence (retired) Florence, Italy [The total number of cases of invasive meningococcal disease caused by serogroup C in Tuscany, Italy since January 2015 is now 54, with 31 cases in 2015, and 23 so far in 2016, compared to 2 cases in 2014 and 3 in 2013. When last reported by ProMED-mail in March 2016, there were a total of 43 cases; 18 of the 43 patients had sepsis only; 14 had sepsis and meningitis; 11 had meningitis only; 10 patients died; there were no secondary cases; and 35 of the 43 strains belonged to C:P1.5-1,10-8:F3-6:ST-11(cc11) (1). (Meningococcal serogroup C cc11 strains are known to cause invasive disease burden worldwide and are responsible for high mortality rates among cases.) The median age of the 43 cases in the Tuscany outbreak was 28 years (range: 9-82); 18 of the 43 cases were over 30 years old, and 11 were over 55 years old. Meningococcal conjugate vaccines (in which bacterial polysaccharide is conjugated to a protein carrier) have several advantages over polysaccharide vaccines, including the ability to induce greater antibody persistence, avidity, immunologic memory, reduced nasopharyngeal carriage of meningococci, and herd immunity, but protection induced by meningococcal vaccines is strictly serotype-specific. Meningococcal serogroup C conjugate (MCC) vaccine was introduced in the Tuscany regional immunization schedule in 2005, with 3 doses to all children at 3, 5, and 13 months of age, and at the national level, MCC was introduced in 2012. The effectiveness of MCC vaccination given in infancy has been found to wane in UK studies after one year, but the numbers of cases of serogroup C disease in the population remained low (2,3) as a consequence of a reduction in the prevalence of serogroup C nasopharyngeal carriage after vaccination leading to high levels of herd protection (4). If herd protection wanes, many children may become vulnerable to infection (5). However, cohorts vaccinated at older ages seem to have greater and longer-lasting protection than those routinely vaccinated in infancy in the UK study. Prompted by the serogroup C outbreak, health officials promoted an MCC vaccination campaign in 2015 in adolescents and adults in the area where serogroup C _N. meningitidis_ disease was reported 2015, which was extended to the whole Tuscany Region and to the elderly in 2016. 1.

The incubation period for Legionnaires' diseases is 2 to 10 days after exposure, which implicates exposure to a water source in the hospital for their illness. The increase in cases of Legionnaires' disease in Flint happened after Flint switched its water source in April 2014 from the city of Detroit's water supply to the Flint River, which runs through the city of Flint. Flint switched back to Detroit water in October 2015. The Flint River water was said to be highly corrosive. Failure to use anti-corrosive treatment on the Flint River water is believed to have led to higher iron, as well as lead, levels in the water after April 2014, according to researchers from Virginia Tech (). Dissolved iron turned the water the color of rust, and free chlorine, which had been added at the treatment plant to help destroy pathogens, was depleted by its interaction with iron pipe. _Legionella_ require the presence of iron to grow. The dissolved iron in the water and lower chlorine levels supported the growth of _Legionella_. Genotyping of patients and environmental _Legionella_ isolates could have established a definitive link between Flint's water and Legionnaires' disease. However, comparing the genotype of _Legionella_ DNA in patients and _Legionella_ DNA isolated from the city's drinking water was reportedly not undertaken during the outbreak (). There were 6-8 cases of Legionnaires' disease per year in the years 2010 to 2013 (); about twice that number of cases have occurred so far this year (2016). It would be important to know whether these cases in 2016 continue to be linked to increased levels of _Legionella_ in Flint's water supply.

4582574,PRO/AH/EDR> Tick-borne encephalitis virus - USA (02): (MA) Powassan virus,2016-10-25 09:51:27,"TICK-BORNE ENCEPHALITIS VIRUS - USA (02): (MASSACHUSETTS) POWASSAN VIRUS ************************************************************************ A ProMED-mail post ProMED-mail is a program of the International Society for Infectious Diseases Date: Fri 21 Oct 2016 [published 7 Oct 2016] Source: OneCape Health News [edited] A recent study showed that some deer ticks on Cape Cod [Massachusetts] are carrying the Powassan virus, which can be transmitted to humans. While a Powassan infection is potentially serious, in most cases people with infected with Powassan never show any symptoms, according to an expert in infectious diseases. 'It's not a reason for people to be extremely worried,' said Patrick J. Cahill, MD, a physician in the infectious disease clinical service departments at Cape Cod Hospital and Falmouth Hospital. 'It's like the other viral encephalidities in that in the vast majority of cases, it's sub-clinical. Most people are not even going to know that they have been exposed to it. It may play a role in some of the longer-term neurologic symptoms that have been traditionally blamed on Lyme.' Larry Dapsis, entomologist and deer tick project coordinator with Barnstable County, collaborated with the Laboratory of Medical Zoology at UMass-Amherst this spring to look for the Powassan virus in deer ticks in 6 Cape Cod locations. Infected ticks were found in Falmouth, Brewster, Orleans and Truro. The percentage of ticks infected with the virus ranged from 2.5 to 10.5 percent, he said. According to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the signs and symptoms of Powassan infection can include: fever, headache, vomiting, weakness, confusion, seizures, and memory loss. 'There is no specific treatment for the virus,' said Dr. Cahill. 'The treatment involves supportive care for symptoms.' No Need To Panic 'While Powassan can be a very serious disease, we compare it to West Nile - serious but quite rare. Looking at the geographic distribution of the ticks, it suggests that Powassan has been on the Cape for some time, likely years,' said Dapsis. 'What we do want the public to know is that we now have 5 tick-borne diseases associated with deer ticks, not 4. It adds another dimension to the mix.' The other tick-borne illnesses are Lyme disease, babesiosis, [_Borrelia] miyamotoi_ and anaplasmosis. 'It's not just about Lyme anymore,' Dapsis said. 'It reinforces our 3-point message about prevention - protect yourself, protect your yard, protect your pets.' The virus was discovered in 1958 in Powassan, Ontario. Since 2013, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health has received reports of 9 cases of the virus in the state. The cases occurred in 4 counties, including Barnstable (the others were Middlesex, Essex and Norfolk Counties). 'It's not something that we're seeing, really, in our hospitals,' Dr. Cahill said. 'As far as clinical infections, there have only been a handful reported in Massachusetts to date, going back as far as we've known about this disease. 'The fact that we've started to detect it in ticks around here likely means that it's been pretty prevalent in ticks across the state for a number of years. Despite that, there have been less than 10 cases in the whole state, showing that overall most people are not affected by this.' Powassan is 'something for medical providers to keep in the back of their minds if somebody's presenting with symptoms consistent with encephalitis [inflammation of the brain]. It's something else that we have to evaluate them for in addition to things like West Nile, Lyme disease and Eastern equine encephalitis.' he added. A Reminder to Protect Yourself The discovery on the Cape of ticks with the Powassan virus is a good reminder to be careful about ticks in general, said Dr. Cahill. Dapsis said that people should check themselves for ticks whenever they've been in wooded areas. He also recommended the use of tick repellants, including Deet-based products, or alternatives like picaridin, for exposed skin. 'In particular I recommend the use of permethrin on clothing and footwear,' he said. 'Footwear is really important since the nymph-stage ticks are down in the leaf litter. In my experience, permethrin-treated clothing and footwear is the most effective tool in the box.' Products containing permethrin, which should be applied on clothing and not the skin, can be found in major garden centers on the Cape, according to Dapsis. He also suggested people consider a perimeter yard spray of tick repellant. 'You can either do it yourself or contract with somebody,' he said. 'Research in Connecticut showed that 85 percent of the people who report getting tick bites got them from working around their own yards. If you have shade trees, bushes and leaf litter, you're going to find ticks.' For more information about tick precautions, read the OneCape Health News article 'Protect yourself from tick-borne infections.' [Byline: Bill O'Neill] -- Communicated by: ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts [With POWV prevalence at 2.5-10 percent, it is a bit surprising that more cases have not occurred. However, most POWV infections are asymptomatic or mild enough that infected individuals may not seek medical attention. Additionally, the deer tick (also black-legged tick, _Ixodes scapulars_) feeds on mammals other than humans, such as white-footed mice (_Peromyscus leucopus_) and white-tailed deer (_Odocoileus virginianus_). As noted in the previous post, the USA CDC notes: 'Human POWV infections have been recognized in the United States, Canada, and Russia. In the United States, cases of POW virus disease have been reported primarily from northeastern states and the Great Lakes region. These cases occur primarily in the late spring, early summer, and mid-fall when ticks are most active. POW virus disease cases are rare but the reported number of cases have increased in recent years. All residents of and visitors to areas where POW virus activity has been identified are at risk of infection. People who engage in outdoor work and recreational activities in endemic areas are at increased risk of infection' (). There is no commercially available vaccine for Powassan virus. The best way to prevent infection is to avoid tick bites. A map showing distribution of human cases by state can be accessed at the CDC URL above.

4583615,"PRO/EDR> Botulism - UK: (Scotland) wound, drug-related",2016-10-25 11:41:25,"BOTULISM - UK: (SCOTLAND) WOUND, DRUG-RELATED ********************************************* A ProMED-mail post ProMED-mail is a program of the International Society for Infectious Diseases Date: Mon 24 Oct 2016 Source: BBC News[edited] A drug user is receiving treatment for suspected botulism in Aberdeen [Scotland]. NHS [National Health Service] Grampian's Health Protection Team is investigating the case, which involved a person injecting drugs. Spores of the botulism bacillus can sometimes contaminate heroin. If injected, it can grow and cause wound infections. The bacterium produces a toxin, which causes a block of nerve transmission resulting in muscular paralysis. NHS Grampian said botulism cases were rare. -- Communicated by: ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts [Injection drug-related wound botulism is reported primarily from parts of Europe and the USA, where black tar heroin seems to be primarily distributed. The following is a discussion regarding black tar heroin, which, because of being injected intramuscularly, can subject the injected drug user to a number of infections, including botulism, tetanus, and necrotizing fasciitis (): Black tar heroin is a type of illegal narcotic derived from morphine. Commonly called black tar heroin, heroin content is not actually what distinguishes this particular drug from other kinds of opiates. While black tar does contain an amount of heroin that can range from 29 to 80 percent, the drug is actually identified by the amount of comparatively crude derivatives of morphine that result from incomplete acetylation. Without delving into the chemistry too exhaustively, black tar is an unrefined product that is made without the complex equipment and chemicals necessary to produce heroin with a high level of purity. Black tar is manufactured primarily in Mexico, and is also commonly referred to as black, brown, manteca, night, or dark. It is also produced in smaller quantities in other parts of Latin America. Black tar use has spread throughout North America and can also be found in parts of Europe. Since the drug does not require the advanced equipment necessary to make pure heroin in white powder form, it is relatively cheap to manufacture and therefore cheap to purchase. It is less expensive to buy than white powder heroin, and it is much less expensive than commonly abused prescription opiates such as vicodin or oxycontin [oxycodone]. Black tar is distinct in appearance from white powder heroin. It ranges in color from black to light brown, and it is sold either as a cola-like chunk, a coarse powder, or a sticky substance with the consistency of melted tar, hence the name. Black tar can be injected in its tar-like form, snorted in its powder form, or smoked. The effects of black tar are similar to the effects of other kinds of opiates, and include feelings of euphoria, relaxation, loss of anxiety, and anesthesia. Side effects can include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, and dry mouth. The most common method of using black tar is injection, and this method poses risks apart from the dangers of the drug itself. For one, black tar users frequently suffer from venous sclerosis, a condition in which the veins shrink and harden. It may become impossible for users to inject intravenously if they develop venous sclerosis, forcing them to resort to subcutaneous injection. However, this method includes its own risks, such as cellulitis and necrotizing fasciitis. When black tar users inject repeatedly, they put themselves at risk for contracting wound botulism due to the impurities and adulterants present in the drug. The sticky consistency of the drug may also put users at greater risk of HIV if they are washing needles and reusing them. The cheapness of black tar has helped to make it comparatively popular among young users who are inexperienced with drug use. Complications from drug use are more common when users are inexperienced. In addition, the impurities present in black tar, as well as the inconsistent ratio of heroin present in the drug, make overdose or death from complications due to the adulterants much more likely. Like all derivatives of morphine, black tar is extremely addictive. Dependency can occur after very few uses, and tolerance can also increase rapidly, causing users to experience irresistible cravings for increasingly large amounts of the drug. - Mod.LL A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: .] [See Also: Botulism - USA (11): (NM) wound, drug-related 20161004.4535918 Botulism - USA (09): (NM) wound, drug-related 20160716.4350262 2015 ---- Botulism - UK (07): (Scotland) wound, drug-related 20151013.3712454 Botulism - UK (06): (Scotland) wound, drug-related 20150615.3437174 Botulism - UK (05): (Scotland) wound, drug-related 20150516.3365249 Botulism - Norway, UK (02): wound, drug-related 20150226.3191370 Botulism - Norway, UK: wound, drug-related 20150219.3176172 Botulism - Norway (02): (OS) wound, drug-related 20150128.3126325 Botulism - UK (03): (Scotland) wound, drug-related 20150127.3122599 Botulism - Norway: (OS) wound, drug-related 20150111.3084384 Botulism - UK (02): (Scotland) wound, drug-related 20150110.3084244 Botulism - UK: (Scotland) wound, drug-related 20150102.3068219 2014 ---- Botulism - USA (12): (CA) wound, drug-related 20141218.3041400 Botulism - USA: (TX) wound, drug-related 20140123.2226243] .................................................sb/ll/mj/mpp",Botulism,"Aberdeen, Scotland, United Kingdom",57.133331,-2.1,Humans

As of today, 23 Oct 2016, a total of 644 suspected cases of cholera, including 3 deaths, have been reported. 31 cases have been laboratory-confirmed so far. Among the deaths, 2 occurred in Sana'a and 1 death occurred in Aden governorate. Acute watery diarrheal diseases are endemic in Yemen. It is the 2nd most common cause of death, especially among infants and school children. As a result of the ongoing conflict, 2/3 of Yemenis do not have access to clean water and sanitation services are limited, especially in cities, further increasing the risk of catching cholera. WHO is working in coordination with the Ministry of Public Health and Population and partners on the ground to run a joint health/WASH task force to coordinate the daily response. WHO is also supporting the Ministry to take necessary public health measures to stop transmission and prevent the spread of cholera to other areas, enhance surveillance, improve case management and raise community awareness in high-risk areas. -- Communicated by: ProMED-mail ****** [2] Cholera - Yemen Date: Sun 23 Oct 2016 14:49 UTC Source: Middle East Eye [edited] Yemen's government announced on [Sun 23 Oct 2016], that 9 people had died of cholera in 2nd city Aden as the infectious disease spread across the war-torn country. 10 other people in the southern port city have been diagnosed with the potentially fatal disease which is transmitted through contaminated drinking water and causes acute diarrhea, the health ministry said. A ministry statement said 190 cases of severe diarrhea had been admitted to hospitals in Aden, which hosts the government's temporary headquarters. The ministry said that around 200 cases of cholera had been reported nationwide. The UN in October 2016 announced an outbreak of cholera in Yemen, the Arabian Peninsula's poorest country even before the war broke out. A Saudi-led coalition began a bombing campaign in March 2015 against rebels who seized the capital Sana'a and large parts of Yemen in a war the UN says has killed nearly 6900 people. The WHO said it had confirmed 11 cases of cholera in Sana'a and warned that the scarcity of drinkable water has worsened hygienic conditions and fuelled a marked increase in cases of severe diarrhea, in particular among people displaced from their homes in central Yemen. -- Communicated by: ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts [Poverty, flooding, drought, and war are the 4 horsemen of cholera. The conditions in the impoverished Arabian peninsula country of Yemen are ideal for the rapid spread of _Vibrio cholerae_. These 2 posts differ widely in both the total number of presumed cases and the number of deaths. Accurate statistics are clearly difficult to assess in Yemen at this point but is likely to rise dramatically in this country of more than 24 million inhabitants.

Health officials warn people not to approach or handle injured bats and flying foxes to avoid exposure to the potentially fatal Australian Bat lyssavirus, which is closely related to the rabies virus. So far this year, more than 400 NSW residents have been given rabies post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) following high-risk exposures to potentially infected animals. About one-quarter had been bitten or scratched by a bat in Australia, while the others had come into contact with potentially rabies-infected animals overseas. Dr. Vicky Sheppeard, Director of NSW Health's Communicable Diseases Branch, said 5 bats had been confirmed as having lyssavirus in NSW this year [2016]. 'We are concerned that with the start of the bat birthing season people may pick up or attempt to rescue young and miscarried pups that may be on the ground,' Dr Sheppeard said. 'Evidence of infection in several bats this year highlights the importance of avoiding bat bites and scratches. Lyssavirus infection can result in a rabies-like illness which is very serious and, if not prevented, fatal. 'There have been 3 cases of lyssavirus in humans in Australia - all in Queensland - and all 3 people died.' Dr Sheppeard said the best protection against exposure to lyssavirus and rabies was to avoid handling any bat in Australia, and any wild or domestic mammal in a rabies-endemic country - including bats, wild or domestic dogs, cats and monkeys. 'You should always assume that all bats and flying foxes are infectious, regardless of whether the animal looks sick,' she said. 'Only people who have been fully vaccinated against rabies (which protects against all lyssaviruses), use protective equipment, and have been trained in bat handling should touch bats.' Dr Sheppeard said if someone was bitten or scratched by any type of bat they should immediately clean the wound thoroughly for at least 5 minutes with soap and water, apply an antiseptic such as Betadine and seek urgent medical advice. 'A series of injections to protect against lyssavirus infection may be required and, if so, the 1st 2 need to be given as soon as possible.

4584430,"PRO/ALL> Obituary: John Payne (Jack) Woodall, Co-founder of ProMED-mail",2016-10-27 21:25:51,"OBITUARY: JOHN PAYNE (JACK) WOODALL, CO-FOUNDER OF PROMED-MAIL ************************************************************** A ProMED-mail post ProMED-mail is a program of the International Society for Infectious Diseases ProMED-mail is deeply saddened to announce the death of its co-founder, Jack Woodall, on Monday evening, 24 Oct 2016, London time. [1] Date: Thu 27 Oct 2016 From: Larry Madoff [edited] To say that Jack was critically important to ProMED-mail's birth, growth, and successes would be a vast understatement. His creativity and foresight led to ProMED's creation, to building it from its 40 original members to the over 80 000 we have today. On his watch, ProMED grew from a handful of dedicated volunteers in 1994 to more than 50 professionals in 35 countries today. Jack articulated and focused the guiding principles that remain integral to our philosophy today. He understood that transparency in disease reporting is necessary for the early discovery of outbreaks. In an era when the International Health Regulations only required a handful of diseases to be reported by the member countries, Jack prided himself on beating the official sector in the public dissemination of outbreak reports. The One Health concept underpins all of our efforts at ProMED. Jack saw early on that so many emerging pathogens were zoonotic and that you could not begin to understand emerging infectious diseases without understanding the health of agricultural animals, wildlife, and the environment. Finally, Jack believed that ProMED should be seen as a complement to the traditional public health system, not an antagonist. That we should not criticize the action (or inaction) of governmental health authorities, but through our example, encourage them to make the right decisions, especially toward transparency. ‎ When I joined ProMED in 2002 (a latecomer compared with some of the others whose comments follow), Jack took me under his wing, sharing his knowledge, insights, and philosophy. He was a type they don't make anymore: The dashing Cambridge/London School-trained Brit traveling the world to where the action was -- perhaps a little bit of a James Bond. Indeed, when I was to meet Jack for the 1st time at a hotel bar, he described himself, tongue only slightly in cheek, as looking like Sean Connery. He became a friend and mentor to me and I was glad to have had the chance to visit with him and Mary in London just 3 weeks ago. We at ProMED rededicate ourselves to fulfilling Jack's vision in service of global health. -- Larry Madoff Editor ProMED-mail ****** [2] Date: Tue 25 Oct 2015 From: Marjorie Pollack [edited] Jack was a remarkable person in many ways -- a brilliant mind, a warm and caring person on both the professional as well as the personal level, and a mentor to too numerous to count individuals, including me. In the obituaries that follow, one sees the picture of a very accomplished scientist working in global health after years as a research virologist with an academic and professional pedigree making him bigger than life. He was passionate in his work, and tenacious to further the goal of disease control and prevention. In his words describing his background for the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine [LSHTM] alumni page (), Jack said, 'I was educated at Bedford School and Clare College Cambridge, and obtained my PhD in entomology and virology at LSHTM in 1956. My 1st position was as a member of Her Majesty's Overseas Research Service, working at the East African Virus Research Institute in the then colonial capital of Uganda, Entebbe. There I was Cubmaster of the only inter-racial Cub Pack in the country, member of the Town Council, Special Constable with the police force, and Entertainment Secretary of the Entebbe Club. My work involved yellow fever and discovery of new viruses' [one of the new viruses included Zika virus and o'nyong'nyong virus]. 'I had visited Brazil as a member of the Cambridge University Amazon Expedition 1954, and after Uganda became independent, I returned to Brazil in 1965 as Director of the Rockefeller Foundation Virus Laboratory in Belém, Pará, where again I carried out research on yellow fever and discovery of new viruses. I left Belém in 1971 to work for the New York State Department of Health on mosquito- and tick-borne viruses. In 1975 I became Director of the San Juan Laboratories of the Centre for Disease Control (CDC), US Public Health Service in Puerto Rico, responsible for the dengue and schistosomiasis programmes there. 'In 1980 I was seconded to the World Health Organization, where I travelled extensively leading teams to assist developing countries in improving their health laboratories, health services management, primary health care, and health financing. I introduced the WHO programme on AIDS to 4 African countries. I was also a member of the WHO Staff Committee, General Secretary of the Federation of International Civil Servants Associations for a year, and editor of UNSpecial, the monthly magazine for United Nations international civil servants in Geneva. 'In 1994 I retired from WHO, returned to my old post with New York State, and co-founded and still work with ProMED-mail, the free online global network reporting outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases (). 'In 1998 I went back to Brazil as Visiting Professor at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), doing research on emerging diseases. I finally retired in 2007 and live in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. 'In 2003 I joined the One Health Initiative team, a pro bono clearing house for global information about the One Health concept, bringing human and veterinary medicine and environmental health workers together to combat the many challenges posed by human diseases emerging from animal reservoirs.' ProMED was Jack's baby and for those of us in the ProMED family he was and will always be the father of ProMED. He, along with Steve Morse and Barbara Hatch Rosenberg were the founders of the Program to Monitor Emerging Diseases, an initiative that was launched in August 1994 in response to the 1991 IOM (Institute of Medicine) review on Emerging Infectious Diseases that concluded there were significant weaknesses in global disease surveillance that would lead to delayed detection of emerging diseases. It was decided to use the then nascent internet as a platform, as well as a source of information through which a network of like-minded individuals, with an interest in emerging infectious diseases could communicate -- a 'social network' in today's parlance. Jack became the public voice in developing this network, starting with 40 individuals. When I subscribed in early April 1995 (after learning of ProMED through word of mouth) Jack was leading the discussions and welcoming new subscribers through posts announcing a new country joining the list of subscribers or through a 'welcome to our 200th subscriber' posting. Early moderators joining Jack included Charlie Calisher and Martin Hugh-Jones. In the early days of ProMED, the discussions were easygoing, often filled with humor in the mod (moderator) comments, but always aimed at increasing the transparency in disease surveillance at the global level. Jack in his role as a mentor, collecting mentees wherever he was, co-opted me to join the ProMED family in 1997. Memories of those days included Jack's drive for ProMED to be 'the 1st kids on the block' to report on outbreaks, with a joy every time ProMED 'got the scoop' before the official sector did. The impact of this approach was to help pave the way for increased transparency and a drive for countries to strive to identify emerging diseases and outbreaks sooner. At one international workshop, a Ministry of Health authority mentioned that in the early days, they 'hated' ProMED, for finding outbreaks and reporting them before the Ministry of Health knew about them. Then they took on the challenge to beat ProMED in reporting globally when an outbreak occurred in their country A testimony to Jack and his efforts. Jack was awarded the prestigious Richard M Taylor award by the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene [ASTMH] this year [2016]. The Richard M Taylor Award is given every 3 years to a person who has made outstanding contributions to arbovirology throughout his or her career. While the award is traditionally given at the ASTMH annual meeting, which will be next month [November 2016], the award was presented to Jack in London at the hospital 2 weeks ago. On the personal side, 'Jack was born in China in the British zone, in Tientsin. His parents were there because his mother's parents had been Missionaries there and his father had gone out as the Headmaster of the International/British School. Both were British/English. He and his family were interned in a Japanese Prison camp for the whole of the war. They had been told to leave China and were booked on a ship leaving from Shanghai sail to UK but when they got there some influential Chinese had taken their tickets and so there was no room for them so they had to stay in China and were put into prison camp. They left for England when the war was over. (Jack always said that it was while he was in prison camp that he was able to wander in a derelict space overgrown with weeds, where he took an interest in insects that a doctor in the camp identified for him, and that started his interest in science.) 'Jack got his US citizenship when he had worked for 9 years with the Rockefeller Foundation [in New York City] and they said he could only remain with them if he took out US citizenship.' But even though he took US citizenship, he did not lose his charming British accent and sense of humor. He is survived by his wonderful loving and devoted companion Mary Crawshaw, and his 5 children by former wives and Mary's 3 daughters who were very close to Jack, with mutual fondness. (The personal details about Jack in quotations above were provided by Mary Crawshaw) Jack, we will miss you sorely. We will miss your tenacity, your corrections if there were mistakes in posts, your delightful sense of humor, your insisting that all Yellow fever posts should be treated as 'RED' (urgent) and be posted at least 2 days before they are finished. We will miss your continued collection of mentees and converts to the ProMED philosophy. But most of all, we will miss your smiling face and all your continued contributions that made you a delight to work with. -- Marjorie P Pollack Deputy Editor ProMED-mail ****** [3] Date: 25-27 Oct 2016 From: ProMED family members - past and present [edited] Stephen Morse Co-founder ProMED-mail Professor Epidemiology at the Columbia University Medical Center Director, Infectious Disease Epidemiology Certificate Program New York City, NY, USA -------------------------------------------------- Jack was truly larger than life. I'll sorely miss his infectious humo(u)r, his insight, his dedication, and his generosity of spirit. Jack was a great inspiration, and remains one of my true heroes. His many contributions to science and to our lives will long be remembered and continue to inspire future generations. **** Charlie Calisher Center for Infection and Immunity Professor, College of Veterinary Medicine & Biomedical Sciences State University Fort Collins, CO, USA -------------------------------------------------- I do not even remember when I first met Jack. Certainly, it was long before 1996, when I joined ProMED as Moderator at Jack's invitation. He and I put together the only e-mail addresses we had and formed a list of people who might be interested in receiving ProMED mail each day. It was a very short list, perhaps 25 names. It grew like Topsy, of course, and pretty soon we were inundated with good information and crap, so we had to be careful to either not post some messages or to post them with comments indicating that we would like more definitive information before we would accept it as fact. That was tough sledding. I was working 10-12 hours each day after work and Jack was probably not sleeping at all. I roomed with him at the ASTMH meetings each year for decades and, if I awoke in the middle of the night, there would be Jack, working on his laptop, getting one more message out. He was not compulsive, he was devoted, to ProMED and to the dissemination of information. We both considered that information should be freely available to all. Jack's legacy will long outlive Jack. Warts and all, like everyone, I loved the guy. [From Charlie's Book 'Lifting the Impenetrable veil']: 'John P Woodall is another of the many experienced, resourceful and accomplished arbovirologists. He was born in what was then British territory in Tientsin (Tianjin), China, a 3rd generation member of a British family in China. After graduating from Cambridge University, in 1958 he obtained a PhD degree from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine at London University. Her Majesty's Overseas Research Service appointed him to the East Africa Virus Research Institute in Entebbe, Uganda, where he stayed long enough to help describe the epidemic of fever caused by o'nyong'nyong' alphavirus with Miles C Williams and Andrew J Haddow and the isolation of Congo virus (now Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever nairovirus) with Williams and David I Simpson. In 1965 Woodall traveled to the Rockefeller Foundation virus laboratories in New York City for additional training, remaining to become a staff member of the Foundation. Later he was appointed director of the Foundation's virus laboratory in Belém, Brazil. His arbovirological accomplishments there included not only virus isolations, but summarizing and documenting the distribution of the arboviruses of Brazil. 'After spending another year with the Foundation when it moved its arbovirus laboratories to Yale University, the peripatetic Woodall moved to the New York State Department of Health Laboratories in Albany, New York, as head of its arbovirus laboratory. Then, from 1975 to 1983 he worked for the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, being stationed in Puerto Rico as the director of the San Juan Laboratories, then taking an assignment at WHO, Geneva. He returned to Albany in 1994 as director of the state arbovirus laboratory, but eventually settled at Brazil's Federal University of Rio de Janeiro in its Institute of Biomedical Sciences. 'Woodall was one of the founding members of ProMED-mail, the Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases, an invaluable internet-based reporting system that rapidly and globally disseminates information on outbreaks of infectious diseases, and which appears in many of our mailboxes each day. He remains an active editor of ProMED-mail and an enthusiastic supporter of the need for rapid, accurate (honest), and complete disease reporting.' **** Martin Hugh-Jones ProMED-mail Animal Disease Assistant Moderator Director, WHO Collaborating Center for Reference and Training in Remote Sensing and Geographic Information Systems for Veterinary Public Health Coordinator, Anthrax Research & Control Working Group Louisiana State University Baton Rouge, LA, USA -------------------------------------------------- You ask for contributions to Jack's in-house obituary. Many great things are being said about the dear man, who is already badly missed, but I think there is already a tendency to indicate that he walked on water. Believe me, he didn't and I probably miss him the more because of his various faults and mistakes. When we recruited a new veterinary moderator, I warned that we all make mistakes and to be patient with Jack, who would sometimes as Top Mod come out with a less than wise editorial decision. I would advise to wait a couple of weeks and he would commit some bloomer that could be used to persuade him to reverse his previous editorial proscription. And low and behold he would and he did. It was and is the moderator group discussion and consensus that Jack initiated that makes being a moderator such a daily pleasure. As I said, Jack did not walk on water and we were the better for it. Our in-house expertise and experience is deeply satisfying, even when we occasionally get it wrong. **** Tom Yuill ProMED-mail Viral Diseases Moderator Emeritus Professor, Pathobiological Sciences, Department of Wildlife Ecology University of Wisconsin-Madison USA -------------------------------------------------- So long Jack, but not goodbye. I have been trying to identify and define the space in my life that Jack occupied. I admired him as a colleague with whom I shared many interests in the biology, natural history, and public health importance of arboviruses. He contributed substantially to the field with his high quality research over many decades. The importance of his contributions were reflected in his receiving the Richard Moreland Taylor award by his arbovirus peers. I admired his ability to not only see the public health consequences of his and others research, he was willing and able to take policy positions on that understanding and act on them. Very recently, although battling cancer, when 11 cases of yellow fever occurred in China, spread from the Angola outbreak, he sounded the alarm about consequences of the spread of yellow fever from that outbreak and he demonstrated a willingness to press for better surveillance and more aggressive vaccination. That also led him to publicly support the 'vaccine sparing' approach using 1/5 of the usual dose when it became clear that the world supply of the vaccine was not adequate to cover the populations at risk. He simply could not remain silent about the yellow fever outbreak and let it run its course with potentially disastrous results. I admired his ongoing commitment to arbovirology and public health after his several 'retirements'. Not one to sit back and take it easy, he took a leadership role in establishing ProMED-mail and its subsequent development and expanding scope. He was also a key player in development of the One Health Initiative. Both are alive, well, and growing -- a continuing monument to Jack. My affection and admiration of Jack as a friend will keep his presence alive in my mind and heart. **** Donald Kaye Associate Editor, ProMED-mail Professor of Medicine Drexel University College of Medicine Philadelphia, PA, USA -------------------------------------------------- Jack was a man of great determination to get things right -- he sought perfection. I found his intellect to be of the highest caliber and he always sought to educate others from his great wealth of experience and his command of the English language. **** Rodrigo Nogueira Angerami ProMED-PORT Moderator State University of Campinas - UNICAMP Campinas, SP, Brazil --------------------------------------------------- Very sad news, very sad to hear that... Words... No words can explain my feelings... Thoughts... Very good and great ones... Dr Jack was a great, kind, patient and perfectionist mentor, tutor, ombudsman... Great man, brilliant mind... Face to face, only twice. But they were always great moments, every time he wrote to me his intelligent, smart, and provocative emails. **** Laura Kramer ProMED-mail Viral Diseases Moderator Director of the Arbovirus Laboratories, Wadsworth Center, New York State Department of Heath Professor of Biomedical Sciences, School of Public Health, State University of NY Albany, NY, USA -------------------------------------------------- I first knew of Jack indirectly through colorful stories recanted by those who worked with him in Belém, Brazil, and I always thought of him as a mythical creature until I finally met him, and was able to appreciate first-hand the power of his personality and expertise. Jack was a friend and a mentor over more years than I care to count. He is one of the foundations of arbovirology upon which everything I do has been built. I have followed in his footsteps from working in the tropics, to directing the Arbovirus Laboratory in the New York State Department of Health, to moderating for ProMED. He always challenged me to be more, do more, and not to shy away from tackling projects I felt were beyond me. He taught me to be a critical thinker and express myself clearly and precisely. Jack has always been bigger than life and someone who will forever be an inspiration even in his absence. I suspect his impact on the field will only grow as we re-examine his legacy, and what a legacy he leaves behind! I will miss him profoundly. **** Peter Cowen ProMED-mail Animal Disease Assistant Moderator Associate Professor of Epidemiology and Public Health, College of Veterinary Medicine North Carolina State University Raleigh, NC, USA -------------------------------------------------- For me, there was always something about him of mythic proportions. The world needs to know more and communicate about emerging diseases; well, then why not just start collecting emails from friends and colleagues and disseminating them? Seems reasonable, so Jack just jumps in. Jack trained me as a moderator and it was his desire to have the best possible item/posting that we could put together in the short term, that really inspired me think hard, do the leg work, and write concisely. He certainly got the best out of me and provided me the most rewarding professional experience of my life. He did with humor, logic, and all by email -- which in those days was a new way to have a professional relationship. We were a small group, just 5 moderators and Jack was leading the merry band who were disrupting the obviously inadequate status quo. Of course, Stephen [Morse] and Barbara [Hatch Rosenberg] would weigh in as well and it really was a group effort, but Jack was the epicenter. Underlying it all, was a sense that we are all called to do the right thing, to make the world we live in better, a more rational and healthy place for all. These days, we could all use Jack's example, that is for sure. I have known many people in the academic infectious disease world. Jack not only cut a striking appearance, he was among a handful of truly special, inspirational, and progressive personalities I have encountered in over 35 years. I will definitely miss him. **** Eskild Peterson ProMED-mail Parasitic Diseases Moderator Editor International Journal of Infectious Diseases Specialist of Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine Department of Infectious Diseases Aarhus University Hospital Skejby, Aarhus, Denmark -------------------------------------------------- It is indeed very sad, but he lived a life more full than most of us and was alert and participating to the last days. Jack was a perfectionist and I believe he read all ProMED-mail postings even in Portuguese, Spanish, and French. His knowledge of widely diverse topics was amazing and he often commented on mod's comments, and if I spelled a species wrong (it does happen) I surely received a mail from Jack. He will be missed. My visit to Mary and Jack in Rio and their visit to my home in Denmark are fine memories. **** Arnon Shimshony ProMED-mail Animal Disease and Zoonoses Moderator Associate-Professor, Koret School of Veterinary Medicine Hebrew University of Jerusalem Jerusalem, Israel -------------------------------------------------- I'm deeply saddened. Jack was at the cradle of ProMED-mail and treasured it ever since, identified with it, and inspired us all. A huge loss. **** Maria Jacobs ProMED-mail Senior Technical Editor Zurich, Switzerland -------------------------------------------------- In 2001, when I started working for ProMED as copy editor and translator for the Spanish regional page, ProMED-ESP, Norman Stein, Executive Director of the International Society for Infectious Diseases (ISID, of which ProMED has been a program since 1999), gave me a copy of the 1998 novel 'The Eleventh Plague: A Novel of Medical Terror' by John S Marr and John Baldwin. The story's protagonist is 'Dr Jack Byrne [surely our Jack], noted virologist who heads the ProMED computer hotline (quite real) and flies about the planet fighting epidemics' (. 'Baldwin and Marr draw upon many real-world resources to add realism and depth to their story, including references to the ProMED system, a database and reporting system used to report and research outbreaks of new diseases.' ( and ). The authors give 'particular thanks to Jack Woodall for providing inspiration.' Jack inspired people in all walks of life and was a hero in a world where infectious diseases and biological warfare are either prevalent, or far from fiction. In his quest for perfection and consistency, Jack wrote the original ProMED-mail Style Guide, and in 2007, when I became ProMED's senior technical editor, he guided me through its revisions, year after year. Jack probably read most posts published in ProMED (more than 50 000) and never hesitated to chide us, moderators and copy editors, for misusing the English language, or missing an important detail. He would add photos, maps, additional resources, anything to help the reader. Much of what I know of style and grammar I learned from Jack, for which I am forever grateful, and I hope he will continue to guide me. **** Susan Baekeland Correspondent, ProMED-mail, plant and animal diseases Normandy, France -------------------------------------------------- Jack was a very generous person, a kind, funny man. His dream was to have ProMED-mail reporting in various languages. He spoke Portuguese, Spanish, French, read all the posts each day including the Plant posts and made comments on them, or picked up mistakes. He was always there to share a joke, answer if you had a problem, or pose a question if there was something he did not understand or wanted more information about. He used to be the Editor of a magazine in Rio, The Umbrella, in which, at his request, I wrote several articles on life in Arabia. If he saw some report or other in the Middle East I would get an email asking about the background to it, not the infectious diseases background but the political one. He kept us on our toes, and we loved him. [Susan wrote the poem below to Jack] The Rose for all its beauty, its scent Is torn apart by the wind, the rain A world torn by rivalry, greed, religion, Yet in this you saw opportunity for excellence. For the creation of ProMED-mail, which will live on. But what does a blind man see in his reflection? When you were our colleague, our friend, our guidance You were our light When you left us your light became fire Your Spirit, Jack, your Guidance will remain with us. It has no limit to define it. -- Communicated by: ProMED-mail ******* [4] Date: Tue 25 Oct 2016 From: Bruce Kaplan, One Health Initiative [edited] Extraordinary Scientist, Admired One Health Supporter-Activist-Leader Dies ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Jack Woodall, PhD (John Payne Woodall) 1935-2016, a viral epidemiologist, scientist and visiting Professor and Director (retd.) Nucleus for the Investigation of Emerging Infectious Diseases at the Institute of Medical Biochemistry, Center for Health Sciences, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil has died after a valiant battle with pancreatic cancer. Dr Woodall was a co-founder and associate editor of ProMED-mail, the outbreak early warning system online of the Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases of the International Society for Infectious Diseases. ProMED-mail was one of Dr Woodall's primary passions since its inception. He became the contents manager/editor of the ProMED-mail section in the One Health Initiative [OHI] website () in February 2009 and retired from that endeavor in May 2016. Jack was an integral member of the One Health Initiative Autonomous pro bono team comprised of Laura H Kahn, MD, MPH, MPP, Bruce Kaplan, DVM, Thomas P Monath, MD, and Lisa A Conti, DVM, MPH. Promotion and support of One Health with the goal of eventual implementation was of great importance to our esteemed colleague, Dr Jack Woodall. Other posts that Dr Woodall held included the Biological Weapons Working Group of the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, Washington DC (USA) since 2004, the Editorial Advisory Board of The Scientist magazine since 2007, and the Editorial Advisory Board, Journal of Medical Chemical, Biological & Radiological Defense since 2008. In addition, he was on the Scientific Advisory Board, Sabin Vaccine Institute, Washington DC from 2004-2006. He has served on the American Committee on Arthropod-Borne Viruses, American Society of Tropical Medicine & Hygiene (ASTMH) and as Web Site Editor of the ASTMH from 2002-2008. Dr Woodall earned his PhD in virology/entomology at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. He was subsequently Senior Scientist for Her Majesty's Overseas Research Service, East African Virus Research Institute, Entebbe, Uganda; a staff member of The Rockefeller Foundation, New York, NY (USA); Director, Belém Virus Laboratory, Belém, Pará, Brazil; Research Fellow, Yale Arbovirus Research Unit, Yale University, New Haven CT (USA); Head, Arbovirus Laboratory, New York State Health Department, Albany NY, (USA); Staff member, US Public Health Service, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), (USA); Director, San Juan Laboratories, San Juan, Puerto Rico; Scientist with the World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland; and Director, Arbovirus Laboratory, New York State Health Department, Albany, NY, (USA). Dr Woodall published numerous articles in peer-reviewed journals. Dr Woodall was an internationally recognized public health authority, educator and One Health leader. Serving as a pro bono contents manager of the ProMED-mail page of the One Health Initiative website, he was an active participant of the autonomous pro bono One Health team of Drs Kahn, Kaplan, Monath, and Conti. He traveled frequently by invitation to promote the online reporting of emerging disease outbreaks and One Health. The One Health Initiative team has suffered a profound and irreplaceable loss with the death of our dear friend and colleague, Jack Woodall. He collaborated brilliantly and freely on every major One Health issue since joining the OHI team in 2009. Numerous email communications were exchanged each week and frequently on a daily basis between the five of us. Laura, Bruce, Tom, and Lisa depended a great deal on Jack's experience and wise insights about a variety of topics. Our hearts go out to his wife Mary and all family members. The national and international One Health community has lost an invaluable, dedicated and trusted advocate with the passing of Jack Woodall. He shall be sorely missed and yet remembered fondly and affectionately.

John Payne Woodall -- known to all as Jack -- was one of the founders of ProMED, an internet-based outbreak reporting system run under the auspices of the International Society for Infectious Diseases. The acronym is short for the Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases. ProMED was established in 1994. Woodall, who was 81 at the time of his death on [Mon 24 Oct 2016], was involved virtually until the end, contributing frequently to discussions about a dangerous yellow fever outbreak in Angola and the Democratic Republic of Congo. The unprecedented size of the outbreak has strained supplies of yellow fever vaccine at points this year and Woodall feared the need would outstrip the supply. He pushed tenaciously for the World Health Organization to recommend use of a fractional dose of vaccine, an approach the organization endorsed in June [2016]. In urgent emails to like-minded scientists and others he thought could influence the cause, Woodall would often sign off with a quote from the cartoon strip 'Calvin and Hobbes.' He described the quote as his motto: 'God put me on this earth to accomplish a certain number of things. Right now I'm so far behind I will never die.' The list of Woodall's accomplishments was long, friends and colleagues said. An arbovirologist, Woodall was involved in some of the earliest research on the Zika virus, which was discovered in Uganda in 1947. He was not involved in the virus's discovery -- he was still a boy at that time -- but reported on finding it in mosquitoes in Uganda, where he worked for a time after graduating with a doctorate in entomology and virology at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. His life and career took him literally around the globe. He spent part of his childhood in China, noted Dr Marjorie Pollack, a friend and fellow ProMED moderator. And as a scientist, he worked at the Rockefeller Foundation in New York, the Belém Virus Laboratory in Brazil, the Yale University arbovirus research unit in New Haven, Connecticut, and the New York State Health Department. Pollack met Woodall in 1977 when he was director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's dengue branch, in San Juan [Puerto Rico]. Later, Woodall spent 14 years at the WHO in Geneva. Pollack described him as 'a delight. He had an inquisitive mind, a brilliant mind, and he would stimulate discussion wherever he was,' she recalled. 'He sometimes would come across professionally as a bull in a china shop if he felt that things that were going on were wrong. ... But that was part of his charm.' Dr Stephen Morse, a professor of infectious diseases at Columbia University, was one of the other cofounders of ProMED. (The 3rd was Barbara Hatch Rosenberg, a molecular biologist.) 'Jack had a remarkable life and did so many things, I once jokingly referred to him as our own Indiana Jones,' Morse said. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, growing concern about the potential use of biological agents in warfare and the risks posed by emerging diseases led to calls for improved surveillance. In the nascent days of the public internet, that wasn't necessarily easy to do, Morse said. But Woodall was keen on the capacity of technology to connect people in public health. ProMED evolved to become an invaluable early warning system, alerting the world of unusual disease activity in southern China that would later become the 2003 SARS outbreak. 'Jack really believed in emerging infectious diseases and fixing the disease surveillance problems, the challenges to find out about outbreaks sooner,' Pollack said. Dr Lawrence Madoff, the editor of ProMED, described Woodall as a character. 'He clearly spoke his mind. He definitely was the 'speak truth to power' type,' he said. That said, Woodall insisted ProMED should not criticize governments for their handling of outbreaks, Madoff said, noting he felt it was more important to engage governments to encourage transparency than to play an adversarial role. Woodall died in London following a battle with pancreatic cancer.

This animal health checkpoint is a crucial part of ensuring animal health and protecting Florida from the spread of this pest. All animals are briefly checked to ensure they do not have screwworm. Early detection of screwworms can be successfully treated in pets and livestock. As of Tuesday [18 Oct 2016], 883 animals had been checked and none were found to have screwworms. - The release of sterile flies, a scientifically proven method to achieve screwworm eradication, began on Tuesday [11 Oct 2016]. The USDA continues to increase production and evaluate additional sites for release. - Enhanced surveillance to determine the scope of the screwworm infestation. - Extensive public outreach in order to engage the public in early detection of the screwworm. Residents who have warm-blooded animals should watch their animals carefully and seek veterinary care for open wounds, then report any potential screwworm cases to 800-HELP-FLA, or 850 410-3800 for non-residents. -- Communicated by: ProMED-mail ****** [2] Date: Wed 12 Oct 2016 Source: Georgia Department of Agriculture [edited] MEMO: New World Screwworm --------------------------------------- Recently New World Screwworm was found in wild deer and pets in the Florida Keys.

Joint director of National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP) Dr Kalpana Baruah, who led the 6-member team, said the disease has been brought under control. 'Now there are sporadic cases of the disease. The situation has improved,' she told reporters after a meeting with Health and Family Welfare Minister Pradip Amat. The Central team had visited the worst-hit areas and interacted with affected people. Baruah said the State Government has taken every possible step to curb outbreak of the vector-borne disease. The district administration is doing a good job as well. Not only Malkangiri, the district administration of Koraput has also taken adequate measures to prevent the disease, she said. On mass vaccination, Dr Baruah said, the decision will be taken at a joint meeting next month [November 2016]. 'However, there will be a training programme for health staff before vaccination starts. The training programme will be conducted in the 2nd week of November [2016],' she said and added that the State will be provided one crore [10 million] long-lasting insecticide treated net (LLIN) in December. The Central team has collected samples of patients, which will be sent for tests. The team toured the district for 3 days to review the measures taken by the State administration after the outbreak of JE. The team had visited Palakonda, Babli, and Koimetol villages and a few hospitals. They had also visited the district headquarters hospital to inspect health condition of patients and held talks with the hospital staff. On [Mon 24 Oct 2016], one more child succumbed to the disease taking the death toll to 66 in 45 days. The deceased was identified as a 5-year-old boy of Barajaguda village. He died while undergoing treatment in the district headquarters hospital at Malkangiri. -- Communicated by: ProMED-mail [The fatal case count for this outbreak has been a bit confusing. The report above indicates that there are 66 fatalities from JE virus infections. A 23 Oct 2016 report published in The Times of India (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20161024.4579882) indicated that the unofficial number of fatalities was 68. A report in the 25 Oct 2016 issue of the New Indian Express () indicated that there have been 61 fatalities. The report above is the 1st one we have seen that indicates that a vaccination campaign against JE is being considered. As of late September 2016, 14 children had died. It is not clear why vaccination was not considered much earlier on, given that mosquito vector control is difficult and not long-lasting. Bed nets have been distributed, which will provide some protection from mosquito bites. Immunity from vaccination provides the best barrier to JE virus infection.

Transmission also occurs in health facilities when personal protection equipment is not employed and barrier nursing practices are not adequate to protect staff from blood and secretions of infected patients. As noted in previous posts, prevention and control of Lassa fever in nature depends on control of the rodent reservoir, which occurs across Nigeria and beyond. Reduction of populations of this rodent will require active participation at the village level. That will necessitate mounting a public education program with support of rodent control technicians.

4586152,PRO/EDR> Vaccination: cost of not vaccinating,2016-10-26 17:37:16,"VACCINATION: COST OF NOT VACCINATING ************************************ A ProMED-mail post ProMED-mail is a program of the International Society for Infectious Diseases Date: 18 Oct 2016, 4:09 PM Source: FiercePharma [edited] Many Americans don't get their vaccines as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Whatever their reasons, when they actually get sick, it's a significant burden to the U.S. economy. Last year, unvaccinated adults cost the economy USD 7.1 billion, an analysis done by the University of North Carolina (UNC) at Chapel Hill found. Researchers at the UNC Eshelman School of Pharmacy examined the cost of care, medication and lost productivity caused by missing the 10 vaccines recommended by the CDC. Those 10 vaccines protect people against 14 pathogens, including influenza, tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis, herpes zoster virus, pneumococcal diseases, meningococcal diseases, measles, mumps, rubella, HPV, chickenpox, hepatitis A and hepatitis B. Flu took the lion's share of the total, accounting for about USD 5.8 billion, with pneumococcal disease and shingles coming in next at USD 1.86 billion and USD 782 million respectively. Americans have traditionally lagged in flu shot adherence. Even though the CDC recommends that everyone 6 months of age and older should be vaccinated against flu every season unless a doctor suggests otherwise, only 42 percent of adults bothered to get 1 during the 2015-2016 flu season, according to a CDC estimate. With AstraZeneca's nasal mist version of the flu vax, FluMist, unavailable this year [2016] because of a deficiency in efficacy, the CDC is worried that the flu vaccination rate could drop even further. Of course, adults' opinions of vaccines can also affect vaccination rates for children. Parental opposition to vaccines recently forced the American Academy of Pediatrics to change its stance to suggest that pediatricians can dismiss parents who don't comply with the recommended vaccine schedules. In 2015, a measles outbreak traced back to Disneyland in California also raised concerns about the growing trend among parents who shun childhood vaccines. The UNC study was funded by Merck, a large vaccine player whose list of products includes HPV vax market leader Gardasil, pneumococcal vax Pneumovax 23 and zoster vaccine Zostavax, among others. The company does not market a flu vaccine. As the goal of the UNC project was to estimate the economic burden of vaccine-preventable diseases rather than to study the impact of vaccination, the research focused on the costs incurred for treating those diseases and did not factor in the cost of vaccination, the study's lead author, Associate Professor Sachiko Ozawa, told FiercePharma in an email. 'Of course our study is just one step, and it would be important to look at the cost of vaccination programs alongside the benefits of vaccination to understand the return on investment,' Ozawa said. According to the adult influenza vaccine price list published by the CDC for the 2016-2017 flu season, a single dose of flu shot can cost from USD 14.41 (Novartis' Fluvirin) to USD 35.75 (Protein Sciences' Flublok) for private providers and citizens. With the adult population of the U.S. around 247.8 million, according to statistics by the U.S. Census Bureau, if that entire population were vaccinated at the USD 14.41 private sector price, the cost would be about USD 3.57 billion. However, it is also possible for individuals to get free flu shots from certain healthcare plans provided by their employers or from taxpayer-funded public health agencies. [Byline: Angus Liu] [A similar report has been publiched in Spanish at: . - Mod.LK] -- Communicated by Kathryn Soderholm [What Would Happen If We Stopped Vaccinations? --------------------------------------------- Before the middle of the last century, diseases like whooping cough, polio, measles, _Haemophilus influenza_, and rubella struck hundreds of thousands of infants, children and adults in the U.S. Thousands died every year from them. As vaccines were developed and became widely used, rates of these diseases declined until today most of them are nearly gone from our country. - Nearly everyone in the U.S. got measles before there was a vaccine, and hundreds died from it each year. Today, most doctors have never seen a case of measles. - More than 15 000 Americans died from diphtheria in 1921, before there was a vaccine. Only 1 case of diphtheria has been reported to CDC since 2004. - An epidemic of rubella (German measles) in 1964-65 infected 12.5 million Americans, killed 2000 babies, and caused 11 000 miscarriages. In 2012, 9 cases of rubella were reported to CDC. Given successes like these, it might seem reasonable to ask, 'Why should we keep vaccinating against diseases that we will probably never see?' Here is why: Vaccines don't just protect you ------------------------------- Most vaccine-preventable diseases are spread from person to person. If one person in a community gets an infectious disease, he can spread it to others who are not immune. But a person who is immune to a disease because she has been vaccinated can't get that disease and can't spread it to others. The more people who are vaccinated, the fewer opportunities a disease has to spread. If 1 or 2 cases of disease are introduced into a community where most people are not vaccinated, outbreaks will occur. In 2013, for example, several measles outbreaks occurred around the country, including large outbreaks in New York City and Texas - mainly among groups with low vaccination rates. If vaccination rates dropped to low levels nationally, diseases could become as common as they were before vaccines. [According to the CDC, 92 percent of measles cases in 2013 were in unvaccinated people. From 2000 to 2011, global measles deaths were reduced from 548 000 to 158 000, with particular success in Sub-Saharan Africa. This accomplishment is credit to the World Health Organization's Measles & Rubella Initiative. - Mod.LK] Diseases haven't disappeared ---------------------------- The United States has very low rates of vaccine-preventable diseases, but this isn't true everywhere in the world. Only one disease -- smallpox -- has been totally erased from the planet. Polio no longer occurs in the U.S., but it is still paralyzing children in several African countries. More than 350 000 cases of measles were reported from around the world in 2011, with outbreaks in the Pacific, Asia, Africa, and Europe. In that same year, 90 percent of measles cases in the U.S. were associated with cases imported from another country. Only the fact that most Americans are vaccinated against measles prevented these clusters of cases from becoming epidemics. Disease rates are low in the United States today. But if we let ourselves become vulnerable by not vaccinating, a case that could touch off an outbreak of some disease that is currently under control is just a plane ride away. A final example: what could happen ---------------------------------- We know that a disease that is apparently under control can suddenly return, because we have seen it happen, in countries like Japan, Australia, and Sweden. Here is an example from Japan. In 1974, about 80 percent of Japanese children were getting pertussis (whooping cough) vaccine. That year there were only 393 cases of whooping cough in the entire country, and not a single pertussis-related death. Then immunization rates began to drop, until only about 10 percent of children were being vaccinated. In 1979, more than 13 000 people got whooping cough and 41 died. When routine vaccination was resumed, the disease numbers dropped again. The chances of your child getting a case of measles or chickenpox or whooping cough might be quite low today. But vaccinations are not just for protecting ourselves, and are not just for today. They also protect the people around us (some of whom may be unable to get certain vaccines, or might have failed to respond to a vaccine, or might be susceptible for other reasons). And they also protect our children's children and their children by keeping diseases that we have almost defeated from making a comeback. What would happen if we stopped vaccinations? We could soon find ourselves battling epidemics of diseases we thought we had conquered decades ago. (Excerpted from ) A significant proportion (estimated to be approximately 30 percent) of those who refuse to be vaccinated with the MMR vaccine stems from a 1998 Lancet publication connecting the MMR vaccine to the development of autism spectrum disorder (the Wakefield controversy). This paper was retracted in 2004, and soon after, the author of the study, Andrew Wakefield, was stripped of his medical license for falsifying data. In the years since, dozens of studies and reports have found no link between MMR vaccine and autism. Nonetheless the myth lives on. Other reasons for low vaccination rates may be lack of health insurance, lack of understanding of the importance to public health, or lack of time to devote to getting families vaccinated. Regardless, the cost of not vaccinating a child with MMR is significant. According to a 2011 publication in J Infec Dis, the cost of responding to and containing 7 measles cases in 2 Arizona hospitals during a single outbreak precipitated by an infected traveler was USD 799 136. This figure did not include effort spent by the state department of health, and was simply the cost of handling the measles itself without severe complications of the disease (Chen SY, Anderson S, Kutty PK, et al.

Belgium, France, and Germany received some of the eggs, according to information filed with the European Commission's Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF). As many as 10 countries may have received the eggs, according to reports from Radio Poland. Croatia and the Netherlands filed official notifications last week [week of 17 Oct 2016] with RASFF. Chicken eggs from Poland were sampled [12 Oct 2016] for _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Enteritidis and the eggs have been withdrawn from the market in Croatia, according to its notification. After testing a large number of eggs, Croatian health authorities have not isolated salmonella in any samples taken, according to the country's agriculture officials. 'Following the official information provided by the Health Ministry about a case of food poisoning caused by _Salmonella_ believed to have come from eggs and a notification received through the EU RASFF food and safety alerts system about a possible salmonellosis outbreak in several member states, Minister Tomislav Tolusic, acting in agreement with the Health Minister, is notifying the public that eggs originating from Poland are being recalled from the market,' the Croatian Agriculture Ministry said in a news release. The European Commission set up a meeting with representatives from several EU countries to discuss the situation. The Polish Agricultural Ministry reported the eggs had been sent to Belgium, the Netherlands, and Croatia, according to Radio Poland. Although distribution details remain unclear, Belgium officials reported the eggs did not go to retailers. However, [according to] the Federal Agency for the Safety of the Food Chain in Belgium, 'several shipments of Polish eggs contaminated with _Salmonella_' were distributed to 7 EU countries, including hundreds of restaurants in Belgium, from 'various Dutch suppliers.' Health, agriculture, and food safety officials in 6 EU countries have been watching the _Salmonella_ outbreak since July 2015. The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) thought the outbreak was over early in 2016, but a surge of new cases that began in April 2016 refocused attention, with the case count estimated at 150 in recent weeks. Amidst the ongoing outbreak, the ECDC reported in August 2016 that salmonellosis declined from 2006 through 2010. 'There was an 8.8 percent reduction in the number of confirmed cases between 2009 (with) 108 618 confirmed cases and 2010 (with) 99 020 confirmed cases. This decline has been attributed to the successful implementation of _Salmonella_ control programs in poultry populations,' according to the August 2016 report. That good news is tempered this week [by a] publication of research in the European journal on infectious diseases, Eurosurveillance, that while control measures have been somewhat successful they have not addressed all laying hens whose eggs are produced for sale. 'Despite the overall decrease in outbreaks of _Salmonella_ infection in the EU, surveillance data since 1991 in Poland have shown that egg products play a pivotal role in the occurrence of salmonellosis outbreaks in humans, with 63 percent of the outbreaks between 2005 and 2010 being linked to this source,' according to the research abstract. 'The most striking increase has been in the proportion of outbreaks due to _S._ Enteritidis infection linked with the consumption of home-produced eggs: surveillance data show an increase from 76 percent of all _S._ Enteritidis outbreaks in 2004 to 82 percent in 2010.'

Researchers, in a short communication in the journal Zoonoses and Public Health [see item [2] below], noted that while Australian native fruit bats have been identified as reservoir hosts, the precise way in which the virus is spread had yet to be explained. Miranda Vidgen and her colleagues said there had been limited investigation of the role of blood-feeding insects as vectors of the virus. Such research, they said, was particularly relevant because of the blood-feeding parasite known as bat flies. The researchers, using molecular detection methods, screened for Hendra virus RNA in 183 bat flies collected from flying-foxes in a Queensland roost. It was later shown that, during the study period, bats in the colony had a Hendra virus RNA prevalence of between 2 percent and 15 percent. The scientists found no evidence of Hendra virus in any of the bat flies tested, including 10 collected from bats in which they had detected Hendra virus RNA.

Although Australian flying-foxes of the genus _Pteropus_ have been identified as reservoir hosts, the precise mechanism of HeV transmission has yet to be elucidated. To date, there has been limited investigation into the role of haematophagous insects as vectors of HeV. This mode of transmission is particularly relevant because Australian flying-foxes host the bat-specific blood-feeding ectoparasites of the genus _Cyclopodia_ (Diptera: Nycteribiidae), also known as bat flies. Using molecular detection methods, we screened for HeV RNA in 183 bat flies collected from flying-foxes inhabiting a roost in Boonah, Queensland, Australia. It was subsequently demonstrated that during the study period, _Pteropus alecto_ in this roost had a HeV RNA prevalence between 2 and 15 percent (95 percent CI [1, 6] to [8, 26], respectively). We found no evidence of HeV in any bat flies tested, including 10 bat flies collected from _P. alecto_ in which we detected HeV RNA.

'The donkey had no vaccine history and was imported from a Louisiana auction into Florida on 16 Oct [2016] with no clinical signs,' the EDCC said. 'Clinical signs began on 18 Oct [2016] and currently the donkey is recovering... Given the travel history and incubation period for WNV, the donkey most likely did not acquire WNV in Palm Beach County.' This is Palm Beach County's 1st confirmed WNV case and Florida's second for 2016. West Nile is transmitted to horses and other equids via bites from infected mosquitoes. Clinical signs for WNV include flulike signs, where the horse seems mildly anorexic and depressed; fine and coarse muscle and skin fasciculations; hyperesthesia (hypersensitivity to touch and sound); changes in mentation (mentality), when horses look like they are daydreaming or 'just not with it'; occasional somnolence (drowsiness); propulsive walking (driving or pushing forward, often without control); and 'spinal' signs, including asymmetrical weakness. Some horses show asymmetrical or symmetrical ataxia. Equine mortality rate can be as high as 30-40 percent. Horse owners should also consult their private practicing veterinarian to determine an appropriate disease prevention plan for their horses. Vaccines have proven to be a very effective prevention tool. Horses that have been vaccinated in past years will need an annual booster shot. However, if an owner did not vaccinate their animal in previous years, the horse will need the 2-shot vaccination series within a 3- to 6-week period. In addition to vaccinations, horse owners also need to reduce the mosquito populations and their possible breeding areas. Recommendations include removing stagnant water sources, keeping animals inside during the bugs' feeding times, which are typically early in the morning and evening, and using mosquito repellents.

According to her, it was done on the recommendation of Rospotrebnadzor, which said: remove dairy products, which has been produced by the Opole [milk processing plant] between 1 and 19 Oct 2016. This is due to the outbreak of FMD [foot-and-mouth disease] in one of the farms of the Vladimir region, which supplied the milk for processing. 'In addition, immediately after receiving information about foot-and-mouth disease, Opole stopped buying milk in this region,' said Zibareva. At the same time, she reported that the share of the supplier of the Vladimir region accounted for only 6-7 tons of milk per day. All in all, Opole processes 220-230 tons of milk per day. Zibareva stressed that the decision on the withdrawal of the product was made despite the fact that the company is confident in the quality of its products. 'This belief is based on the fact that the processing involves only safe raw milk, which is accompanied by a veterinary certificate certifying that the milk was derived from healthy cows, and on the fact that all raw milk undergoes thermal treatment, which guarantees the destruction of the FMD virus. The company has a strict control quality of incoming raw materials and finished products,' she explained. The decision on the withdrawal concerns only a limited range of products, manufactured by 'Opole' for the period from 1 to 19 Oct 2016, and has not been extended to other of the company's products. According to the letter of Rospotrebnadzor in Moscow, which was sent to trade organizations, it referred to the total withdrawal of almost 3.8 thousand tons of production in that period. We are talking about yogurt, drinking milk, soured milk. The letter to WBD retailers specifies that this is a product under the brand name 'The House in the Village.' Rospotrebnadzor also recommended that the seized products are put under isolated storage. As reported, the outbreak of FMD was discovered in a farm located in the village Vyshmanovo in the Vladimir region. It contained 800 heads of cattle. The causes of infection are currently under investigation by law enforcement. The village has been subject to quarantine. All economic ties with the village have been stopped. Entry and exit are allowed through traffic control posts. In the area, an increased control upon the movement of meat and dairy products has been introduced, and all cattle are being vaccinated. Foot-and-mouth disease is an acute viral disease that is accompanied by severe symptoms, blisters and ulcerative lesions of the mucous membranes and skin. The virus is also infectious to humans.

According to the vice-governor Rusanov, the virus was detected at a very early stage of the outbreak and is localized in one sector of the village, called Sobinsky area that is now under quarantine. The total number of cattle in the farm is 797 heads, of which nearly 400 are [milking] cows. All livestock has been vaccinated immediately after the outbreak and will be monitored for 14 days. Those cows that have been confirmed with FMD will go for slaughter. By 24 Oct 2016, 100 of them have been slaughtered. The cows are being killed by a bloodless method, via lethal injection. Their carcasses are transported to the burial site, burned, and the ashes are treated with bleach. Despite the fact that not all animals may get sick, according to Roman Rusanov the final decision may eventually be to eliminate all of them. 'There are different opinions, but most likely we will eliminate the farm in order to prevent the spread to other farms of the entire province. It should not hurt economy of the province too much.' Samples of biomaterial showed that the animals 'picked up' FMD virus type Asia 1, which is common in Asian countries. How the exotic strain could end up in the province of Vladimir region is not clear. 'The virus is widespread in Turkey and registered there on a daily basis. Together with experts from Rosselkhoznadzor veterinary and law enforcement agencies, we are trying to identify a source and the route of transmission of the virus to our region. When we will learn, we will share it with a public. For now, we need to concentrate on localizing the outbreak and preventing the spread via vaccination,' said Roman Rusanov. The vice-governor could not recall when Vladimir had the latest outbreak of FMD. In the spring of 2016 the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) has recognized Russia free from FMD [without vaccination]. The last mandatory vaccination against FMD in the Vladimir region was conducted in 2013. After that, the Russian Ministry of Agriculture has delegated the authority to make a decision about vaccination to the provinces. 'It was a decision of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rosselkhoznadzor that FMD is not a mandatory vaccination. Now the governor decided that we will vaccinate 100 percent of the cattle in our province to prevent such outbreaks. We will take it very seriously from now on,' said Rusanov. Mass vaccination of cows is expected to end on 25 Oct 2016. Of the 131 000 heads of cattle in the herds of the Vladimir region, more than 104 000 have already been vaccinated. All cows (100 percent) of the cows on public [commercial] farms are vaccinated, but it is harder to ensure the same coverage rate on private farms where, so far, about 75 percent of the cattle have been vaccinated so far. The vice-governor Rusanov called upon all private owners of cattle to be proactive and directly reach out to veterinarians for vaccination, which should be free. According to him, the region has enough vaccines. During the quarantine period in the village Vyshmanovo, selling raw unpasteurized milk is prohibited throughout the entire Vladimir region. In addition, as a temporary measure, cattle will not be allowed to exit the village. -- Communicated by: ProMED-mail ****** [3] Kazakhstan bans imports from Russia Date: Tue 25 Oct 2016 Source: Regnum [in Russian, mach. trans., summ., edited] Due to the outbreak of FMD in Vladimir oblast, Kazakhstan has imposed restrictions on imports of Russian agricultural products of animal origin, as of 25 Oct 2016, according to the National Chamber of Entrepreneurs. The Chamber informs that on 20 Oct 2016, the Office International des Epizooties (OIE) informed about the reported FMD outbreak in the territory of the village Vyshmanovo, Vladimir region, Russia. In such situations, the sequence of actions is regulated at the international level, says the Chamber. 'In accordance with Article 8.8.2 of the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code, one of the requirements for an FMD-free zone is that FMD vaccination has not been carried out there and that FMD has been absent for the last 12 months on the territory of the zone. Vladimir region is part of Russia's FMD-free zone without vaccination, officially assigned by the OIE in 2016,' says the Chamber [see ]. According to the organization, on 24 Oct 2016, the Ministry of Agriculture of Kazakhstan informed the Rosselkhoznadzor in writing that, subject to the epizootic situation, it was decided to introduce since 25 Oct 2016 restrictions on the import from the Russian republic of agricultural products of the following categories: FMD susceptible animals; beef; pork; lamb; milk and dairy products; finished products which have not undergone successful heat-treatment in accordance with the recommendations of the OIE Code; non-food raw materials and products derived from the slaughter of FMD susceptible animals; used equipment for their maintenance, slaughter and processing, feed and feed additives for animals; feed and feed additives for animal and plant origin animal. The Chamber provides a list of the [52] provinces of the Russian Federation, included in the above area: Bashkortostan, Karelia, Komi, Mari El Republic, Mordovia, Sakha (Yakutia), North Ossetia - Alania, Tatarstan, Udmurtia, Khakassia Republic, Chuvashia Republic, Autonomous Republic of Crimea, Kamchatka Territory, Krasnoyarsk, Perm, Arkhangelsk region, Belgorod oblast, Bryansk region, the Vladimir region, the Vologda region, the Voronezh region, the Ivanovo region, the Irkutsk region, the Kaliningrad region, the Kaluga region, the Kemerovo region, Kirov region, Kostroma region, Kursk region, Leningrad region, the Lipetsk region, the Magadan region, the Moscow region, the Murmansk region, Nizhny Novgorod region, Novgorod region, Orel region, the Penza region, Pskov region, Ryazan region, Sakhalin region, Sverdlovsk region, Smolensk region, Tambov region, Tver region, Tomsk region , Tula region, Ulyanovsk region, Yaroslavl region, Nenets, Khanty-Mansi Autonomous District, Yamalo-Nenets Chukotka Autonomous District. 'The Committee of veterinary control and supervision of the Ministry of Agriculture has notified in writing the territorial division of the limitations and the need for strict observance of regulations,' added in the House. Recall that in August 2016, due to the outbreak of nodular dermatitis [lumpy skin disease] in Atyrau oblast, Kazakhstan, Russia imposed a temporary ban on the import from Kazakhstan of cattle, meat and skins. -- Communicated by: ProMED-mail [Restrictions on imports of FMD-related products from Russia have been reported from other countries as well. The Russian authorities have undertaken severe measures to speed up the eradication of this enigmatic outbreak, which reportedly was detected at an early stage of its unfolding. Publication of the genotyping results of the FMDV strain involved are anticipated the earliest; the virus, reportedly confirmed in the laboratory on 19 Oct 2016 (RT-PCR, ELISA, CFT), is expected to be genotyped by the All-Russian FMD laboratory, recognised by the OIE as an FMD reference laboratory. ProMED awaits these results once available. The withdrawal of pasteurised dairy products from the distribution channels, explained as related to public-health considerations, deserves to be explained. FMD is generally not regarded to be of significant risk to public health; on the contrary, most references (and the personal experience of several of ProMED-mail's moderators) indicate that human infections by FMD virus are, on top of their mildness, extremely rare (see also commentary in the 2 postings 20010504.0859, 20010429.0831). The following citation [from the FMD chapter, (revised March 2015)] addresses the issue adequately: 'Public Health: Foot-and-mouth disease is not considered to be a public health problem, as infections seem to be very rare and their consequences mild. In the past, many people who worked with FMDV in vaccine laboratories or other locations developed antibodies to this virus, but there were few clinical cases. One laboratory reported only 2 cases in more than 50 years, and a large FMD vaccine manufacturer documented 3 cases among its workers. It may be that exposure to extremely large amounts of virus or a predisposing condition is necessary for infection. Between 1921 and 1969, reports of more than 40 laboratory-confirmed cases of FMD in humans were published. The symptoms included vesicular lesions and influenza-like symptoms, and the disease was generally mild, short-lived and self-limiting. Broken skin was a recognized route of entry for some human cases, with the initial lesions developing at the inoculation site. There is also a report that 3 veterinarians deliberately infected themselves in 1934, by drinking virus-contaminated, unpasteurized milk for 3 days. Person-to-person transmission has never been reported; however, vesicles from affected people do contain virus.'

In can cause more serious complications and in rare cases is deadly, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Mumps cases are on the rise in New Hampshire and across the country, Chan said. From 2011 to 2015, there were 5 mumps cases in New Hampshire. So far this year [2016], there have been 9 cases, Chan said.

This is troubling news and greatly impacts not only this year's [2016] season, but possibly future seasons, too. According to The Capital Journal, due to the level of the outbreak, South Dakota Game, Fish, & Parks (SDGFP) officials will not distribute any leftover antlerless tags for 11 East River hunting units. Any hunter with a license for any of the East River hunting units or Units 45A and 45B in Lyman County can turn in unused tags for a full refund and reinstatement of preference points. 'These actions are intended to lessen the impact on deer populations in hunting units where management objectives are to maintain or increase deer populations,' says Chad Switzer, wildlife program administrator. EHD is caused by a biting midge and spreads quickly, often killing an infected deer within days. According to Andy Lindbloom, a senior SDGFP big game biologist, the disease seems to be running rampant primarily in the central and southeastern portions of the state and 'seems to affect white-tailed deer far more than mule deer.' Lindbloom adds that a hard freeze will likely slow EHD's reach, but not eliminate it completely. While EHD hasn't been confirmed to harm humans, it's recommended that you don't eat the meat from a diseased animal.

RSV is a fairly common lung disease especially in the rainy season. Its symptoms include fever and it can be serious to infants and old people in particular, reports Daily News. Dr Jirarut Chomcheuy said on his Facebook page (BigJira Praise) that ignorance of the disease is widespread. After a picture was posted of a one month old child with the infection he said that the main problem was that parents were ignorant. People need to realize that close proximity to siblings or others with the disease can result in the virus being passed on. While it was true that it was more prevalent in the rainy season that was only part of the problem. The main way to prevent it is to keep the vulnerable away from those who are infected. Out of 10 ICU [intensive care unit] beds at a Korat [Nakhon Ratchasima] hospital, 9 were filled with people suffering the effects of the virus. Sufferers needed respirators. The disease can last for a week and there is no vaccine available to treat it. -- Communicated by: ProMED-mail [Maps of Thailand can be seen at and . Nakhon Ratchasima province, also known as Korat, is one of the northeastern provinces of Thailand. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ A review of the global burden of RSV estimates an annual incidence of approximately 34 million episodes of ALRI (acute lower respiratory infections) associated with RSV infection in children aged younger than 5 years [1]. Just over 3 million episodes were estimated to result in hospitalization and between 66 000 and 199 000 in death [1]. Most deaths (99 percent) occur in the developing world [1]. Infants have consistently higher rates of RSV-associated illness and hospitalization than older children in both industrialized and developing nations [2]. The report above from Thailand is indicative of the RSV disease burden in various regions of the world. The high burden of RSV-associated morbidity and mortality makes the development of safe and effective vaccines a priority. Several candidates are in development.

The EDCC report said the following equids tested positive for the virus: - An unvaccinated 8-year-old pony gelding located in Choctaw County showed severe neurologic signs, including leg paralysis, and was euthanized. - An unvaccinated yearling Quarter Horse filly from Payne County was showed moderate neurologic signs, including hind-limb ataxia. - An unvaccinated 16-year-old Quarter Horse gelding in Beckham County showed mild neurologic signs and is recovering. - A 7-year-old Quarter Horse gelding located in Atoka County [that] showed severe neurologic signs, including hind-limb paralysis, and was euthanized. That horse's vaccination history is unknown. The new cases bring Oklahoma's case total to 9 for the year [2016]. West Nile Virus is transmitted to horses and other equids via bites from infected mosquitoes. Clinical signs for WNV include flu-like signs, where the horse seems mildly anorexic and depressed; fine and coarse muscle and skin fasciculations; hyperesthesia (hypersensitivity to touch and sound); changes in mentation (mentality), when horses look like they are daydreaming or 'just not with it'; occasional somnolence (drowsiness); propulsive walking (driving or pushing forward, often without control); and 'spinal' signs, including asymmetrical weakness. Some horses show asymmetrical or symmetrical ataxia. Equine mortality rate can be as high as 30-40 percent. Horse owners should also consult their private practicing veterinarian to determine an appropriate disease prevention plan for their horses. Vaccines have proven to be a very effective prevention tool. Horses that have been vaccinated in past years will need an annual booster shot. However, if an owner did not vaccinate their animal in previous years, the horse will need the 2-shot vaccination series within a 3- to 6-week period. In addition to vaccinations, horse owners also need to reduce the mosquito populations and their possible breeding areas. Recommendations include removing stagnant water sources, keeping animals inside during the bugs' feeding times, which are typically early in the morning and evening, and using mosquito repellents.

The California Department of Public Health said the state ranks 1st for syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia and congenital syphilis. And the rates are up for the 2nd year in a row. 'Cases of syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia are going up in California at a concerning rate,' Dr. Karen Smith, director of the California Department of Public Health, said Tuesday [25 Oct 2016]. 'This is the 2nd year in a row that we have seen increases in all 3 diseases.' The report found an 11.6 percent increase in STDs from 2014, with a total of 249 224 reportable cases in California for 2015. State health officials cite less condom use, people having sex with more partners and barriers to care and testing as reasons for the rising STD rates. Improved reporting of the diseases by public health agencies could also be a contributing factor, the state said. Syphilis is still the least common of the 3 STDs, but is particularly worrisome because it has led to resurgence in congenital syphilis, in which an infected pregnant mother transmits the disease to her newborn baby. Congenital syphilis can lead to miscarriages, stillbirths, jaundice and meningitis. There were 142 babies born with syphilis in California in 2015, a big jump from 30 cases in 2012. California now has the 2nd highest rate of congenital syphilis nationwide. Fresno County health officials said social media could be fueling the increase in STDs statewide by providing an easy means for people to have multiple sexual partners. But in Fresno County, drug use is driving an epidemic of syphilis cases. The county had the 2nd-highest rate of syphilis in the state in 2015. 'As a general rule, syphilis had primarily been an illness of men having sex with men, but now in our community it's with people who use methamphetamine and it's taken off just like wildfire,' said Dr. Ken Bird, the county's health officer. Methamphetamine users tend to have several sexual partners and they tend not to use condoms, Bird said. California's STD rates are highest among people 15 to 24 years old and especially females. Gay and bisexual men are also at high risk. California's in the process of giving USD 5 million in grants to county health departments for STD prevention, testing and treatment.

This case count corresponds to a rate of 478.8 cases per 100 000 population, an increase of 5.9 percent compared with the rate in 2014. During 2014-2015, the rate of reported _Chlamydia_ cases among women increased 3.8 percent and the rate among men increased 10.5 percent. Following 3 years of decreases in rates during 2011-2014, the rate among women aged 15-19 years increased 1.5 percent during 2014-2015. In 2015, the overall rate of chlamydial infection in the United States among women (645.5 cases per 100 000 females) based on reported cases was over 2 times the rate among men (305.2 cases per 100 000 males), reflecting the larger number of women screened for this infection. However, with the increased availability of urine testing and extragenital testing, men, including gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (collectively referred to as MSM) are increasingly being tested for chlamydial infection. During 2011-2015, the chlamydia rate in men increased 20.0 percent, compared with a 0.3 percent increase in women during this period. Gonorrhea --------- In 2009, the national rate of reported gonorrhea cases reached an historic low of 98.1 cases per 100 000 population. However, during 2009-2012, the rate increased slightly each year to 106.7 cases per 100 000 population in 2012 and then increased again during 2013-2015. In 2015, 395 216 gonorrhea cases were reported for a rate of 123.9 cases per 100 000 population, an increase of 12.8 percent from 2014. During 2014-2015 the rate of reported gonorrhea increased 18.3 percent among men and 6.8 percent among women. Gonorrhea rates among both men and women increased in every region of the United States, with largest increases in the West and the South. The magnitude of the increase among males suggests either increased transmission or increased case ascertainment (e.g., through increased extra-genital screening) among MSM or both. In 2015, the rate of reported gonorrhea cases remained highest among Blacks (424.9 cases per 100 000 population) and among American Indians/Alaska Natives (192.8 cases per 100 000 population). While rates of gonorrhea declined 4 percent among Blacks during 2011-2015, rates increased among all other racial and ethnic groups, including a 71.3 percent increase among American Indians/Alaska Natives. Antimicrobial resistance remains an important consideration in the treatment of gonorrhea. With increased resistance to the fluoroquinolones and declining susceptibility to cefixime, dual therapy with ceftriaxone and azithromycin is now the only CDC recommended treatment for gonorrhea. In 2015, the percentage of MICs (minimum inhibitory concentrations) of cefixime and ceftriaxone remained low (0.5 percent and 0.3 percent, respectively). During 2013-2015, the percentage of isolates with reduced azithromycin susceptibility increased from 0.6 percent to 2.6 percent. Continued monitoring of susceptibility patterns to these antibiotics is critical. Syphilis -------- In 2000 and 2001, the national rate of reported primary and secondary (P&S) syphilis cases was 2.1 cases per 100 000 population, the lowest rate since reporting began in 1941. However, the P&S syphilis rate has increased almost every year since 2001. In 2015, a total of 23 872 P&S syphilis cases were reported, and the national P&S syphilis rate increased to 7.5 cases per 100 000 population, a 19.0 percent increase from 2014. During 2014-2015, the P&S syphilis rate increased both among men (18.1 percent) and women (27.3 percent) and rates increased among both sexes in every region of the country. Nationally, P&S syphilis rates increased in every 5-year age group among those aged 15-64 years and in every racial and ethnic group except for American Indians/ Alaska Natives during 2014-2015. During 2000-2015, the rise in the P&S syphilis rate was primarily attributable to increased cases among men and, specifically, among MSM. In 2015, men accounted for over 90 percent of all cases of P&S syphilis. Of those male cases for whom sex of sex partner was known, 81.7 percent were MSM. Reported cases of P&S syphilis continued to be characterized by a high rate of HIV co-infection, particularly among MSM. In the 31 states able to classify at least 70 percent of reported P&S syphilis cases as MSM, men who have sex with women (MSW), or women and at least 70 percent of reported cases as HIV-positive or HIV-negative, 49.8 percent of MSM with P&S syphilis were also reported as HIV-positive compared with 10.0 percent of cases among MSW and 3.9 percent of cases among women. The 2013 rate of congenital syphilis (9.2 cases per 100 000 live births) marked the 1st increase in congenital syphilis since 2008. During 2013-2014, the rate increased 27.2 percent and during 2014-2015 increased 6.0 percent, primarily attributable to an increase in the West. There were 487 cases of congenital syphilis reported in 2015 compared with 461 in 2014. Rates of congenital syphilis were highest among Blacks (35.2 cases per 100 000 live births), followed by Hispanics (15.5 cases per 100 000 live births) and American Indians/Alaska Natives (10.3 cases per 100 000 live births).

Because chlamydial infections are usually asymptomatic, the number of infections identified and reported can increase as more people are screened. Consequently rates of reported cases of chlamydia are influenced not only by actual changes in incidence of infection, but also by improved screening coverage. Also use of more sensitive tests (e.g., nucleic acid amplification tests) and more complete reporting contributed to increasing incidence rates. After having reached a historic low in 2009, the national rate of reported gonorrhea cases increased again during 2014-2015, largely attributable to increases among men, accompanied by the emergence of decreased susceptibility and resistance to cephalosporins and azithromycin. As with chlamydial infection, screening practices (e.g., screening for chlamydia with tests that also detect gonococcal infections or increased screening at extra-genital anatomic sites), the broader use of nucleic acid amplification tests, and changes in reporting practices have contributed to the increased incidence rates. After reaching historic lows in 2000 and 2001, the national rate of reported P&S syphilis cases increased almost every year since then. This increase was largely attributable to an increase among men, and in particular among men who have sex with men (MSM). However, during 2014-2015, rates increased among both men and women in every region of the country. Accompanying the increase in women, rates of reported congenital syphilis cases also increased during 2014-2015, although this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in the West. - Mod.ML A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: .] [See Also: Syphilis, gonococcal disease, chlamydia, HIV - USA: (CA) LA, MSM, condom use 20160930.4527847 Syphilis - USA (10): MSM, increase syphilis screening 20160925.4514369 Gonococcal disease - USA (05): (HI) ceftriaxone plus azithromycin resistance 20160924.4513277 Syphilis - USA (09): (MS) MSM, PrEP 20160921.4503803 Syphilis - USA (08): (NM) ocular 20160828.4446416 Gonococcal disease - USA (04): (NH) 20160825.4441082 Gonococcal disease - USA (03): increasing azithromycin resistance, 2014 20160716.4349791 Syphilis - USA (07): (New York City) women, rising incidence 20160713.4342960 Syphilis, gonococcal disease, chlamydia - USA (03): (CA) incr. incidence, 2015 20160620.4298962 Syphilis, gonococcal disease, chlamydia - USA (02): (IL) incr. incidence, 2015 20160613.4283744 Gonococcal disease & chlamydia - USA: (ME) rising incidence, young 20160602.4259953 Syphilis - Canada & USA: Bicillin shortage 20160503.4199492 Syphilis - USA (06): (TX, AL) rising incidence 20160501.4195453 Gonococcal disease - USA (02): (MT) increased incidence 20160413.4155835 Syphilis - USA (05): (CA) pregnant women, congenital, rising incidence 20160403.4136361 Syphilis - USA (04): (NC) incr. incidence, ocular, MSM, HIV, anon. online dating 20160320.4107520 Syphilis - USA (03): (CA) pregnant women, congenital, rising incidence 20160315.4094546 Syphilis - USA (02): (ID) rising incidence, MSM, substance abuse, mobile apps 20160305.4070537 Syphilis - USA: (NV) rising incidence, MSM 20160226.4052496 Syphilis, gonococcal disease, chlamydia - USA: (MN) rising incidence, young, MSM, women 20160209.4005647 Gonococcal disease - USA: (WA) increased incidence, methamphetamine 20160131.3975209 2015 ---- Syphilis - USA (16): pregnant women, congenital, rising incidence 20151114.3791354] .................................................sb/ml/ao/mpp",Chlamydia,United States,39.96693,-97.556099,Humans

The California Department of Public Health said the state ranks 1st for syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia and congenital syphilis. And the rates are up for the 2nd year in a row. 'Cases of syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia are going up in California at a concerning rate,' Dr. Karen Smith, director of the California Department of Public Health, said Tuesday [25 Oct 2016]. 'This is the 2nd year in a row that we have seen increases in all 3 diseases.' The report found an 11.6 percent increase in STDs from 2014, with a total of 249 224 reportable cases in California for 2015. State health officials cite less condom use, people having sex with more partners and barriers to care and testing as reasons for the rising STD rates. Improved reporting of the diseases by public health agencies could also be a contributing factor, the state said. Syphilis is still the least common of the 3 STDs, but is particularly worrisome because it has led to resurgence in congenital syphilis, in which an infected pregnant mother transmits the disease to her newborn baby. Congenital syphilis can lead to miscarriages, stillbirths, jaundice and meningitis. There were 142 babies born with syphilis in California in 2015, a big jump from 30 cases in 2012. California now has the 2nd highest rate of congenital syphilis nationwide. Fresno County health officials said social media could be fueling the increase in STDs statewide by providing an easy means for people to have multiple sexual partners. But in Fresno County, drug use is driving an epidemic of syphilis cases. The county had the 2nd-highest rate of syphilis in the state in 2015. 'As a general rule, syphilis had primarily been an illness of men having sex with men, but now in our community it's with people who use methamphetamine and it's taken off just like wildfire,' said Dr. Ken Bird, the county's health officer. Methamphetamine users tend to have several sexual partners and they tend not to use condoms, Bird said. California's STD rates are highest among people 15 to 24 years old and especially females. Gay and bisexual men are also at high risk. California's in the process of giving USD 5 million in grants to county health departments for STD prevention, testing and treatment.

This case count corresponds to a rate of 478.8 cases per 100 000 population, an increase of 5.9 percent compared with the rate in 2014. During 2014-2015, the rate of reported _Chlamydia_ cases among women increased 3.8 percent and the rate among men increased 10.5 percent. Following 3 years of decreases in rates during 2011-2014, the rate among women aged 15-19 years increased 1.5 percent during 2014-2015. In 2015, the overall rate of chlamydial infection in the United States among women (645.5 cases per 100 000 females) based on reported cases was over 2 times the rate among men (305.2 cases per 100 000 males), reflecting the larger number of women screened for this infection. However, with the increased availability of urine testing and extragenital testing, men, including gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (collectively referred to as MSM) are increasingly being tested for chlamydial infection. During 2011-2015, the chlamydia rate in men increased 20.0 percent, compared with a 0.3 percent increase in women during this period. Gonorrhea --------- In 2009, the national rate of reported gonorrhea cases reached an historic low of 98.1 cases per 100 000 population. However, during 2009-2012, the rate increased slightly each year to 106.7 cases per 100 000 population in 2012 and then increased again during 2013-2015. In 2015, 395 216 gonorrhea cases were reported for a rate of 123.9 cases per 100 000 population, an increase of 12.8 percent from 2014. During 2014-2015 the rate of reported gonorrhea increased 18.3 percent among men and 6.8 percent among women. Gonorrhea rates among both men and women increased in every region of the United States, with largest increases in the West and the South. The magnitude of the increase among males suggests either increased transmission or increased case ascertainment (e.g., through increased extra-genital screening) among MSM or both. In 2015, the rate of reported gonorrhea cases remained highest among Blacks (424.9 cases per 100 000 population) and among American Indians/Alaska Natives (192.8 cases per 100 000 population). While rates of gonorrhea declined 4 percent among Blacks during 2011-2015, rates increased among all other racial and ethnic groups, including a 71.3 percent increase among American Indians/Alaska Natives. Antimicrobial resistance remains an important consideration in the treatment of gonorrhea. With increased resistance to the fluoroquinolones and declining susceptibility to cefixime, dual therapy with ceftriaxone and azithromycin is now the only CDC recommended treatment for gonorrhea. In 2015, the percentage of MICs (minimum inhibitory concentrations) of cefixime and ceftriaxone remained low (0.5 percent and 0.3 percent, respectively). During 2013-2015, the percentage of isolates with reduced azithromycin susceptibility increased from 0.6 percent to 2.6 percent. Continued monitoring of susceptibility patterns to these antibiotics is critical. Syphilis -------- In 2000 and 2001, the national rate of reported primary and secondary (P&S) syphilis cases was 2.1 cases per 100 000 population, the lowest rate since reporting began in 1941. However, the P&S syphilis rate has increased almost every year since 2001. In 2015, a total of 23 872 P&S syphilis cases were reported, and the national P&S syphilis rate increased to 7.5 cases per 100 000 population, a 19.0 percent increase from 2014. During 2014-2015, the P&S syphilis rate increased both among men (18.1 percent) and women (27.3 percent) and rates increased among both sexes in every region of the country. Nationally, P&S syphilis rates increased in every 5-year age group among those aged 15-64 years and in every racial and ethnic group except for American Indians/ Alaska Natives during 2014-2015. During 2000-2015, the rise in the P&S syphilis rate was primarily attributable to increased cases among men and, specifically, among MSM. In 2015, men accounted for over 90 percent of all cases of P&S syphilis. Of those male cases for whom sex of sex partner was known, 81.7 percent were MSM. Reported cases of P&S syphilis continued to be characterized by a high rate of HIV co-infection, particularly among MSM. In the 31 states able to classify at least 70 percent of reported P&S syphilis cases as MSM, men who have sex with women (MSW), or women and at least 70 percent of reported cases as HIV-positive or HIV-negative, 49.8 percent of MSM with P&S syphilis were also reported as HIV-positive compared with 10.0 percent of cases among MSW and 3.9 percent of cases among women. The 2013 rate of congenital syphilis (9.2 cases per 100 000 live births) marked the 1st increase in congenital syphilis since 2008. During 2013-2014, the rate increased 27.2 percent and during 2014-2015 increased 6.0 percent, primarily attributable to an increase in the West. There were 487 cases of congenital syphilis reported in 2015 compared with 461 in 2014. Rates of congenital syphilis were highest among Blacks (35.2 cases per 100 000 live births), followed by Hispanics (15.5 cases per 100 000 live births) and American Indians/Alaska Natives (10.3 cases per 100 000 live births).

Accompanying the increase in women, rates of reported congenital syphilis cases also increased during 2014-2015, although this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in the West. - Mod.ML A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: .] [See Also: Syphilis, gonococcal disease, chlamydia, HIV - USA: (CA) LA, MSM, condom use 20160930.4527847 Syphilis - USA (10): MSM, increase syphilis screening 20160925.4514369 Gonococcal disease - USA (05): (HI) ceftriaxone plus azithromycin resistance 20160924.4513277 Syphilis - USA (09): (MS) MSM, PrEP 20160921.4503803 Syphilis - USA (08): (NM) ocular 20160828.4446416 Gonococcal disease - USA (04): (NH) 20160825.4441082 Gonococcal disease - USA (03): increasing azithromycin resistance, 2014 20160716.4349791 Syphilis - USA (07): (New York City) women, rising incidence 20160713.4342960 Syphilis, gonococcal disease, chlamydia - USA (03): (CA) incr. incidence, 2015 20160620.4298962 Syphilis, gonococcal disease, chlamydia - USA (02): (IL) incr. incidence, 2015 20160613.4283744 Gonococcal disease & chlamydia - USA: (ME) rising incidence, young 20160602.4259953 Syphilis - Canada & USA: Bicillin shortage 20160503.4199492 Syphilis - USA (06): (TX, AL) rising incidence 20160501.4195453 Gonococcal disease - USA (02): (MT) increased incidence 20160413.4155835 Syphilis - USA (05): (CA) pregnant women, congenital, rising incidence 20160403.4136361 Syphilis - USA (04): (NC) incr. incidence, ocular, MSM, HIV, anon. online dating 20160320.4107520 Syphilis - USA (03): (CA) pregnant women, congenital, rising incidence 20160315.4094546 Syphilis - USA (02): (ID) rising incidence, MSM, substance abuse, mobile apps 20160305.4070537 Syphilis - USA: (NV) rising incidence, MSM 20160226.4052496 Syphilis, gonococcal disease, chlamydia - USA: (MN) rising incidence, young, MSM, women 20160209.4005647 Gonococcal disease - USA: (WA) increased incidence, methamphetamine 20160131.3975209 2015 ---- Syphilis - USA (16): pregnant women, congenital, rising incidence 20151114.3791354] .................................................sb/ml/ao/mpp",Syphilis,United States,39.96693,-97.556099,Humans

The California Department of Public Health said the state ranks 1st for syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia and congenital syphilis. And the rates are up for the 2nd year in a row. 'Cases of syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia are going up in California at a concerning rate,' Dr. Karen Smith, director of the California Department of Public Health, said Tuesday [25 Oct 2016]. 'This is the 2nd year in a row that we have seen increases in all 3 diseases.' The report found an 11.6 percent increase in STDs from 2014, with a total of 249 224 reportable cases in California for 2015. State health officials cite less condom use, people having sex with more partners and barriers to care and testing as reasons for the rising STD rates. Improved reporting of the diseases by public health agencies could also be a contributing factor, the state said. Syphilis is still the least common of the 3 STDs, but is particularly worrisome because it has led to resurgence in congenital syphilis, in which an infected pregnant mother transmits the disease to her newborn baby. Congenital syphilis can lead to miscarriages, stillbirths, jaundice and meningitis. There were 142 babies born with syphilis in California in 2015, a big jump from 30 cases in 2012. California now has the 2nd highest rate of congenital syphilis nationwide. Fresno County health officials said social media could be fueling the increase in STDs statewide by providing an easy means for people to have multiple sexual partners. But in Fresno County, drug use is driving an epidemic of syphilis cases. The county had the 2nd-highest rate of syphilis in the state in 2015. 'As a general rule, syphilis had primarily been an illness of men having sex with men, but now in our community it's with people who use methamphetamine and it's taken off just like wildfire,' said Dr. Ken Bird, the county's health officer. Methamphetamine users tend to have several sexual partners and they tend not to use condoms, Bird said. California's STD rates are highest among people 15 to 24 years old and especially females. Gay and bisexual men are also at high risk. California's in the process of giving USD 5 million in grants to county health departments for STD prevention, testing and treatment.

This case count corresponds to a rate of 478.8 cases per 100 000 population, an increase of 5.9 percent compared with the rate in 2014. During 2014-2015, the rate of reported _Chlamydia_ cases among women increased 3.8 percent and the rate among men increased 10.5 percent. Following 3 years of decreases in rates during 2011-2014, the rate among women aged 15-19 years increased 1.5 percent during 2014-2015. In 2015, the overall rate of chlamydial infection in the United States among women (645.5 cases per 100 000 females) based on reported cases was over 2 times the rate among men (305.2 cases per 100 000 males), reflecting the larger number of women screened for this infection. However, with the increased availability of urine testing and extragenital testing, men, including gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (collectively referred to as MSM) are increasingly being tested for chlamydial infection. During 2011-2015, the chlamydia rate in men increased 20.0 percent, compared with a 0.3 percent increase in women during this period. Gonorrhea --------- In 2009, the national rate of reported gonorrhea cases reached an historic low of 98.1 cases per 100 000 population. However, during 2009-2012, the rate increased slightly each year to 106.7 cases per 100 000 population in 2012 and then increased again during 2013-2015. In 2015, 395 216 gonorrhea cases were reported for a rate of 123.9 cases per 100 000 population, an increase of 12.8 percent from 2014. During 2014-2015 the rate of reported gonorrhea increased 18.3 percent among men and 6.8 percent among women. Gonorrhea rates among both men and women increased in every region of the United States, with largest increases in the West and the South. The magnitude of the increase among males suggests either increased transmission or increased case ascertainment (e.g., through increased extra-genital screening) among MSM or both. In 2015, the rate of reported gonorrhea cases remained highest among Blacks (424.9 cases per 100 000 population) and among American Indians/Alaska Natives (192.8 cases per 100 000 population). While rates of gonorrhea declined 4 percent among Blacks during 2011-2015, rates increased among all other racial and ethnic groups, including a 71.3 percent increase among American Indians/Alaska Natives. Antimicrobial resistance remains an important consideration in the treatment of gonorrhea. With increased resistance to the fluoroquinolones and declining susceptibility to cefixime, dual therapy with ceftriaxone and azithromycin is now the only CDC recommended treatment for gonorrhea. In 2015, the percentage of MICs (minimum inhibitory concentrations) of cefixime and ceftriaxone remained low (0.5 percent and 0.3 percent, respectively). During 2013-2015, the percentage of isolates with reduced azithromycin susceptibility increased from 0.6 percent to 2.6 percent. Continued monitoring of susceptibility patterns to these antibiotics is critical. Syphilis -------- In 2000 and 2001, the national rate of reported primary and secondary (P&S) syphilis cases was 2.1 cases per 100 000 population, the lowest rate since reporting began in 1941. However, the P&S syphilis rate has increased almost every year since 2001. In 2015, a total of 23 872 P&S syphilis cases were reported, and the national P&S syphilis rate increased to 7.5 cases per 100 000 population, a 19.0 percent increase from 2014. During 2014-2015, the P&S syphilis rate increased both among men (18.1 percent) and women (27.3 percent) and rates increased among both sexes in every region of the country. Nationally, P&S syphilis rates increased in every 5-year age group among those aged 15-64 years and in every racial and ethnic group except for American Indians/ Alaska Natives during 2014-2015. During 2000-2015, the rise in the P&S syphilis rate was primarily attributable to increased cases among men and, specifically, among MSM. In 2015, men accounted for over 90 percent of all cases of P&S syphilis. Of those male cases for whom sex of sex partner was known, 81.7 percent were MSM. Reported cases of P&S syphilis continued to be characterized by a high rate of HIV co-infection, particularly among MSM. In the 31 states able to classify at least 70 percent of reported P&S syphilis cases as MSM, men who have sex with women (MSW), or women and at least 70 percent of reported cases as HIV-positive or HIV-negative, 49.8 percent of MSM with P&S syphilis were also reported as HIV-positive compared with 10.0 percent of cases among MSW and 3.9 percent of cases among women. The 2013 rate of congenital syphilis (9.2 cases per 100 000 live births) marked the 1st increase in congenital syphilis since 2008. During 2013-2014, the rate increased 27.2 percent and during 2014-2015 increased 6.0 percent, primarily attributable to an increase in the West. There were 487 cases of congenital syphilis reported in 2015 compared with 461 in 2014. Rates of congenital syphilis were highest among Blacks (35.2 cases per 100 000 live births), followed by Hispanics (15.5 cases per 100 000 live births) and American Indians/Alaska Natives (10.3 cases per 100 000 live births). [The full report is available at the source URL.] -- Communicated by: ProMED-mail [The CDC is reporting that the number of cases of sexually transmitted diseases in the U.S. reached an all-time high last year (2015). The reported incidences rose from 2014 by 5.9 percent for chlamydia, 12.8 percent for gonorrhea, and a 19 percent for primary and secondary (P&S) syphilis. Because chlamydial infections are usually asymptomatic, the number of infections identified and reported can increase as more people are screened. Consequently rates of reported cases of chlamydia are influenced not only by actual changes in incidence of infection, but also by improved screening coverage. Also use of more sensitive tests (e.g., nucleic acid amplification tests) and more complete reporting contributed to increasing incidence rates. After having reached a historic low in 2009, the national rate of reported gonorrhea cases increased again during 2014-2015, largely attributable to increases among men, accompanied by the emergence of decreased susceptibility and resistance to cephalosporins and azithromycin. As with chlamydial infection, screening practices (e.g., screening for chlamydia with tests that also detect gonococcal infections or increased screening at extra-genital anatomic sites), the broader use of nucleic acid amplification tests, and changes in reporting practices have contributed to the increased incidence rates.

Accompanying the increase in women, rates of reported congenital syphilis cases also increased during 2014-2015, although this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in the West. - Mod.ML A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: .] [See Also: Syphilis, gonococcal disease, chlamydia, HIV - USA: (CA) LA, MSM, condom use 20160930.4527847 Syphilis - USA (10): MSM, increase syphilis screening 20160925.4514369 Gonococcal disease - USA (05): (HI) ceftriaxone plus azithromycin resistance 20160924.4513277 Syphilis - USA (09): (MS) MSM, PrEP 20160921.4503803 Syphilis - USA (08): (NM) ocular 20160828.4446416 Gonococcal disease - USA (04): (NH) 20160825.4441082 Gonococcal disease - USA (03): increasing azithromycin resistance, 2014 20160716.4349791 Syphilis - USA (07): (New York City) women, rising incidence 20160713.4342960 Syphilis, gonococcal disease, chlamydia - USA (03): (CA) incr. incidence, 2015 20160620.4298962 Syphilis, gonococcal disease, chlamydia - USA (02): (IL) incr. incidence, 2015 20160613.4283744 Gonococcal disease & chlamydia - USA: (ME) rising incidence, young 20160602.4259953 Syphilis - Canada & USA: Bicillin shortage 20160503.4199492 Syphilis - USA (06): (TX, AL) rising incidence 20160501.4195453 Gonococcal disease - USA (02): (MT) increased incidence 20160413.4155835 Syphilis - USA (05): (CA) pregnant women, congenital, rising incidence 20160403.4136361 Syphilis - USA (04): (NC) incr. incidence, ocular, MSM, HIV, anon. online dating 20160320.4107520 Syphilis - USA (03): (CA) pregnant women, congenital, rising incidence 20160315.4094546 Syphilis - USA (02): (ID) rising incidence, MSM, substance abuse, mobile apps 20160305.4070537 Syphilis - USA: (NV) rising incidence, MSM 20160226.4052496 Syphilis, gonococcal disease, chlamydia - USA: (MN) rising incidence, young, MSM, women 20160209.4005647 Gonococcal disease - USA: (WA) increased incidence, methamphetamine 20160131.3975209 2015 ---- Syphilis - USA (16): pregnant women, congenital, rising incidence 20151114.3791354] .................................................sb/ml/ao/mpp",Syphilis,"California, United States",37.250198,-119.750298,Humans

The California Department of Public Health said the state ranks 1st for syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia and congenital syphilis. And the rates are up for the 2nd year in a row. 'Cases of syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia are going up in California at a concerning rate,' Dr. Karen Smith, director of the California Department of Public Health, said Tuesday [25 Oct 2016]. 'This is the 2nd year in a row that we have seen increases in all 3 diseases.' The report found an 11.6 percent increase in STDs from 2014, with a total of 249 224 reportable cases in California for 2015. State health officials cite less condom use, people having sex with more partners and barriers to care and testing as reasons for the rising STD rates. Improved reporting of the diseases by public health agencies could also be a contributing factor, the state said. Syphilis is still the least common of the 3 STDs, but is particularly worrisome because it has led to resurgence in congenital syphilis, in which an infected pregnant mother transmits the disease to her newborn baby. Congenital syphilis can lead to miscarriages, stillbirths, jaundice and meningitis. There were 142 babies born with syphilis in California in 2015, a big jump from 30 cases in 2012. California now has the 2nd highest rate of congenital syphilis nationwide. Fresno County health officials said social media could be fueling the increase in STDs statewide by providing an easy means for people to have multiple sexual partners. But in Fresno County, drug use is driving an epidemic of syphilis cases. The county had the 2nd-highest rate of syphilis in the state in 2015. 'As a general rule, syphilis had primarily been an illness of men having sex with men, but now in our community it's with people who use methamphetamine and it's taken off just like wildfire,' said Dr. Ken Bird, the county's health officer. Methamphetamine users tend to have several sexual partners and they tend not to use condoms, Bird said. California's STD rates are highest among people 15 to 24 years old and especially females. Gay and bisexual men are also at high risk. California's in the process of giving USD 5 million in grants to county health departments for STD prevention, testing and treatment.

This case count corresponds to a rate of 478.8 cases per 100 000 population, an increase of 5.9 percent compared with the rate in 2014. During 2014-2015, the rate of reported _Chlamydia_ cases among women increased 3.8 percent and the rate among men increased 10.5 percent. Following 3 years of decreases in rates during 2011-2014, the rate among women aged 15-19 years increased 1.5 percent during 2014-2015. In 2015, the overall rate of chlamydial infection in the United States among women (645.5 cases per 100 000 females) based on reported cases was over 2 times the rate among men (305.2 cases per 100 000 males), reflecting the larger number of women screened for this infection. However, with the increased availability of urine testing and extragenital testing, men, including gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (collectively referred to as MSM) are increasingly being tested for chlamydial infection. During 2011-2015, the chlamydia rate in men increased 20.0 percent, compared with a 0.3 percent increase in women during this period. Gonorrhea --------- In 2009, the national rate of reported gonorrhea cases reached an historic low of 98.1 cases per 100 000 population. However, during 2009-2012, the rate increased slightly each year to 106.7 cases per 100 000 population in 2012 and then increased again during 2013-2015. In 2015, 395 216 gonorrhea cases were reported for a rate of 123.9 cases per 100 000 population, an increase of 12.8 percent from 2014. During 2014-2015 the rate of reported gonorrhea increased 18.3 percent among men and 6.8 percent among women. Gonorrhea rates among both men and women increased in every region of the United States, with largest increases in the West and the South. The magnitude of the increase among males suggests either increased transmission or increased case ascertainment (e.g., through increased extra-genital screening) among MSM or both. In 2015, the rate of reported gonorrhea cases remained highest among Blacks (424.9 cases per 100 000 population) and among American Indians/Alaska Natives (192.8 cases per 100 000 population). While rates of gonorrhea declined 4 percent among Blacks during 2011-2015, rates increased among all other racial and ethnic groups, including a 71.3 percent increase among American Indians/Alaska Natives. Antimicrobial resistance remains an important consideration in the treatment of gonorrhea. With increased resistance to the fluoroquinolones and declining susceptibility to cefixime, dual therapy with ceftriaxone and azithromycin is now the only CDC recommended treatment for gonorrhea. In 2015, the percentage of MICs (minimum inhibitory concentrations) of cefixime and ceftriaxone remained low (0.5 percent and 0.3 percent, respectively). During 2013-2015, the percentage of isolates with reduced azithromycin susceptibility increased from 0.6 percent to 2.6 percent. Continued monitoring of susceptibility patterns to these antibiotics is critical. Syphilis -------- In 2000 and 2001, the national rate of reported primary and secondary (P&S) syphilis cases was 2.1 cases per 100 000 population, the lowest rate since reporting began in 1941. However, the P&S syphilis rate has increased almost every year since 2001. In 2015, a total of 23 872 P&S syphilis cases were reported, and the national P&S syphilis rate increased to 7.5 cases per 100 000 population, a 19.0 percent increase from 2014. During 2014-2015, the P&S syphilis rate increased both among men (18.1 percent) and women (27.3 percent) and rates increased among both sexes in every region of the country. Nationally, P&S syphilis rates increased in every 5-year age group among those aged 15-64 years and in every racial and ethnic group except for American Indians/ Alaska Natives during 2014-2015. During 2000-2015, the rise in the P&S syphilis rate was primarily attributable to increased cases among men and, specifically, among MSM. In 2015, men accounted for over 90 percent of all cases of P&S syphilis. Of those male cases for whom sex of sex partner was known, 81.7 percent were MSM. Reported cases of P&S syphilis continued to be characterized by a high rate of HIV co-infection, particularly among MSM. In the 31 states able to classify at least 70 percent of reported P&S syphilis cases as MSM, men who have sex with women (MSW), or women and at least 70 percent of reported cases as HIV-positive or HIV-negative, 49.8 percent of MSM with P&S syphilis were also reported as HIV-positive compared with 10.0 percent of cases among MSW and 3.9 percent of cases among women. The 2013 rate of congenital syphilis (9.2 cases per 100 000 live births) marked the 1st increase in congenital syphilis since 2008. During 2013-2014, the rate increased 27.2 percent and during 2014-2015 increased 6.0 percent, primarily attributable to an increase in the West. There were 487 cases of congenital syphilis reported in 2015 compared with 461 in 2014. Rates of congenital syphilis were highest among Blacks (35.2 cases per 100 000 live births), followed by Hispanics (15.5 cases per 100 000 live births) and American Indians/Alaska Natives (10.3 cases per 100 000 live births). [The full report is available at the source URL.] -- Communicated by: ProMED-mail [The CDC is reporting that the number of cases of sexually transmitted diseases in the U.S. reached an all-time high last year (2015). The reported incidences rose from 2014 by 5.9 percent for chlamydia, 12.8 percent for gonorrhea, and a 19 percent for primary and secondary (P&S) syphilis. Because chlamydial infections are usually asymptomatic, the number of infections identified and reported can increase as more people are screened. Consequently rates of reported cases of chlamydia are influenced not only by actual changes in incidence of infection, but also by improved screening coverage. Also use of more sensitive tests (e.g., nucleic acid amplification tests) and more complete reporting contributed to increasing incidence rates. After having reached a historic low in 2009, the national rate of reported gonorrhea cases increased again during 2014-2015, largely attributable to increases among men, accompanied by the emergence of decreased susceptibility and resistance to cephalosporins and azithromycin. As with chlamydial infection, screening practices (e.g., screening for chlamydia with tests that also detect gonococcal infections or increased screening at extra-genital anatomic sites), the broader use of nucleic acid amplification tests, and changes in reporting practices have contributed to the increased incidence rates. After reaching historic lows in 2000 and 2001, the national rate of reported P&S syphilis cases increased almost every year since then. This increase was largely attributable to an increase among men, and in particular among men who have sex with men (MSM). However, during 2014-2015, rates increased among both men and women in every region of the country.

The 6 died at Akwachatis Clinic in the county after doctors tried for a week to treat them. According to doctors at the clinic, the 6 were among over 100 people alleged to have consumed the meat last week. 'They all came here complaining of stomach pains and diarrhea. It is then that we found out that they had consumed meat from the carcass of a camel that died as a result of disease without knowing that the sickness was deadly,' said Paul Chebet, a nurse at the clinic. Nelson Lotela, a local leader at Silale in Baringo, confirmed that the camel had died as a result of a disease, but the villagers disregarded the fact. He advised villagers in surrounding towns to avoid consuming camel meat until all camels in the area were inspected. In 2015, 54 people died after eating meat from a sick cow. [Byline: Atieno Mboya] -- Communicated by: ProMED-mail [There is not adequate information to define the cause of this outbreak of illness following the ingestion of meat from a camel carcass. It is not stated how many of the 100 or so villagers became ill, so a case-fatality rate (CFR) cannot be calculated, but if all ca. 100 became ill, a 6% CFR is significant for a gastroenteritis, as the CFR for cholera is around 1%. If fewer were affected, the CFR would be higher. Therefore, the usual bacterial (and viral) causes of foodborne illness such as Salmonella, Campylobacter, enterohemorrhagic E. coli and Brucella are unlikely, and brucellosis generally does not produce prominent diarrhea. It is also possible that some toxic substance was involved. Certainly camels have been shown to harbor the MERS coronavirus, and the infection may cause diarrhea, however, it primarily causes respiratory symptoms (1). Of note, the WHO considers certain groups to be at high risk for severe MERS; these groups include people with diabetes, kidney failure, or chronic lung disease, and people who have weakened immune systems. The World Health Organization recommends that these groups take additional precautions (): - Avoid contact with camels; - Do not drink raw camel milk or raw camel urine; - Do not eat undercooked meat, particularly camel meat. Two infections that deserve some consideration in the initial differential diagnosis here are anthrax and plague. Gastrointestinal anthrax most often develops after eating contaminated meat, with an incubation period of 1-7 days after the ingestion of spores from the meat (2-4). It may occur as an oropharyngeal form or an intestinal form, with the latter presenting with nausea, vomiting, fever and diarrhea, often bloody, but watery diarrhea has been reported. A relatively unique form of transmission occurred after an animal hide drumming event (5). Gastrointestinal involvement with _Y. pestis_ occurs, and the classical form after ingestion is in the pharynx, and has been reported after the ingestion of camel meat (6), although 2 of the 12 reported cases also had diarrhea. In that regard, a cluster of gastroenteritis cases without oropharyngeal involvement following the eating or handling of camel meat has been reported from Afghanistan, with a 20% CFR (17 of 83) (7). For the reader's interest, the following is from a blog regarding eating camel meat, with a recipe (): 'Camel meat was reasonably popular back then, popular enough for doctors to gravely warn against eating too much of it (in the manner of doctors throughout the ages). They held it to be 'heating' and to 'engender thick blood,' and declared it suitable only 'for those who do exhausting labor.' Or suffer from 'hot stomach' and diarrhea, oddly. There was a special word for camel meat, jazur, which basically means 'that which is slaughtered.' Occasionally, the word was applied to mutton, but most of the recipes mention hump, which is kind of a giveaway that we're talking camel. There's a whole chapter of camel stews in the 10th-century book Kitab al-Tabikh. Here's the 1st recipe. Pay attention in case you ever need to stew camel, complete with its hump. (Anissa: and if you do, here below is where you can find it at Malak Lahm el-Jamal, which is what the Arabic sign says, meaning the king of camel meat!) Camel rib and leg meat Camel hump Onions Vinegar Soy sauce Pepper Coriander Caraway Mixed spices (abzar, probably like the baharat or hawayij of modern Arab cookery) Slice up the meat and hump as if you were going to make the medieval fry-up called qaliyya. Cook the sliced meat in a pot until it gives up all its moisture, then add onions and the sliced hump and cook everything together until the hump renders its fat. Add the vinegar, soy sauce, pepper, coriander, caraway and mixed spices to taste (the recipe gives no measurements at all) and continue cooking until everything is done. Yes, they had a sort of soy sauce in the medieval Arab world. Murri was made by culturing barley the same way that soy beans are cultured in the Far East. The 2nd jazuriyya recipe is pretty much the same as the 1st, except that instead of soy sauce, you add bunn, which was the rotted barley paste from which the barley 'soy sauce' was pressed. It must be significant that the heading of chapter 77 says it contains bunniyyat as well as jazuriyyat. None of the 6 dishes in the chapter is actually named bunniyya, but 5 of them contain either bunn or soy sauce. I've never had camel meat; maybe its flavor just cries out for soy sauce. But maybe not. Kitab al-Tabikh describes a royal Persian dish called (in Arabic) ma-wa-milh. The recipe calls for hump (sanam) as well as meat from the back, belly and thighs (of an unnamed animal, but if you have a hump, you pretty much already have a whole camel lying around). However, ma-wa-milh was a soupy stew with hand-cut noodles in it served with a garnish of garlic and walnuts stewed in broth. No soy sauce. I retract my theory.'

Kevin Lowry, chief public information officer with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service at the National Key Deer Refuge, said even though the parasitic screwworm larvae have caused the deaths of 114 Key deer, none had to be euthanized Tuesday [25 Oct 2016]. He said officials are optimistic the numbers will continue to come down, preserving the Key deer population, which was estimated at about 1000 before the deaths and euthanizations of infected deer began in July [2016]. The deer, just 3 feet high, are found only in the Florida Keys and are on the Endangered Species List. Asked about the possibility of moving some Key deer off the refuge to save them, he said translocating some could be considered in preservation efforts but nothing has been confirmed. 'The main thing we want to do is keep them here and not remove them,' he said. 'The population could become stable here quickly. It's a very good sign to have zero deer euthanized for the latest report and it's all about making sure they remain in their native environment.' Lowry said the number is dropping due to the efforts of refuge officers and the help of 120 volunteers on Big Pine and No Name who are treating deer with doramectin, an antiparasitic medicine that serves as a preventive measure and treatment for screwworm. Initial treatments began last week. After receiving a dose of doramectin on a piece of bread, the deer are marked with nontoxic paint in a specific color for the day they're treated to tell refuge staff those deer were treated. 'We have developed neighborhood strike teams, so when the volunteers are properly trained, we're identifying neighborhoods and they're being labeled to that area,' Lowry said. 'Then they report to pick up supplies and materials and are charged with reporting back the number of deer they've treated.' Screwworm flies lay their eggs in open wounds where larvae hatch and feed, basically eating the deer alive. Many of the deer wounds are believed to come from rutting -- males battling each other for mates. So far, 259 females and 176 males have been treated with doramectin. Sterile male screwworms continue to be released to mate with female flies as well, a successful method to kill the population created by the U.S. Department of Agriculture in the 1960s. Dr. Doug Mader, veterinarian and owner of the Marathon Veterinary Hospital, said pet owners should check their pets twice a day. He has seen 2 pigs, 1 cat and 1 dog put down because of the screwworm and said owners shouldn't wait to take their animal to a veterinarian if they see signs of screwworm. As of Tuesday [25 Oct 2016], state Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services law enforcement officers have inspected 1644 animals heading out of the Keys at an inspection point at mile marker 106 in Key Largo and found no instances of the screwworm fly. Those interested in volunteering to treat Key deer should email Kristie Killam, refuge park ranger, at keydeer@fws.gov. To report an infected deer, call (305) 470-6863, Ext. 7.

This week, as the number of dead deer continued to climb, the refuge's small staff crowded the room, loading tinfoil trays with white bread slathered in orange blossom honey and injected with a potent antiparasitic. A ranger filled squirt bottles with purple paint while another packed Ziploc bags with chopped fruit to both lure and reward deer for taking the bitter medicine. Volunteers and biologists hustled in and out, grabbing rubber gloves to protect themselves from the drug as they headed out on sorties into deer habitat. Up the road, a U.S. Department of Agriculture [USDA] command center at the airport in Marathon is undertaking something not done in the Southeastern U.S. in half a century: eradication of the New World screwworm. With the number of deer deaths reaching 114 as of Tuesday [25 Oct 2016], the entomologists, GIS experts, vets and biologists fighting the outbreak ramped up their efforts this week. The assault is simple in theory -- attack on 2 fronts by protecting the deer with a prophylactic drug and eliminating the flies with squadrons of infertile breeding partners -- but complicated in execution. Biologists say the deer are susceptible to capture myopathy, meaning they can literally die of fear, so tracking and treating them has been tricky. Such a large-scale effort has never been undertaken on the herd. And fighting screwworm across wetlands and a dense pine rockland -- the largest tract in the U.S. outside Everglades National Park -- is entirely new territory. 'It's not something we ever expected,' said refuge biologist Adam Emerick, who 1st noticed bucks turning up with grisly wounds in mid September [2016] and, after wondering whether something might be amiss, collected 4 samples to test for parasites. Over the weekend [22-23 Oct 2016], the refuge's staff trained 50 volunteers on how to lure and feed the deer -- something strictly forbidden over the years in an attempt to keep the herd wild, said park ranger Kristie Killam. So far, 335 have been treated in a herd estimated at about 1000. Monday [24 Oct 2016] also marked the 1st day since officials began documenting the outbreak that no deer were euthanized, a rare bit of good news, said U.S. Fish and Wildlife spokesman Kevin Lowry. Entomologists have also begun releasing sterile screwworms to mate with wild flies. They plan on releasing about 2.7 million each week, produced at a Panamanian lab jointly run with the USDA. Because the screwworms haven't appeared in the U.S. in so long, entomologists are identifying hotspots based on conditions in other counties, said Scott Peterich, a wildlife mitigation specialist with the Florida Forest Service who is pitching in to provide mapping expertise. But the mix of habitat in the Keys is proving challenging. 'They say go there, but then we find out there's mangrove and water and we can't go there,' Peterich said. On Monday, Killam, Emerick and 2 other biologists searched spots favored by the deer -- an overgrown coconut farm now used to house refuge interns and still called the Nut Farm and along Key Deer Boulevard. The deer readily ate the bread after being lured with the fruit. Staffers continue to wrestle with how to reach more reclusive wild deer deeper in the refuge. The drug, doramectin, needs to be re-administered every 7 days. For tamer deer, volunteers and staffers are marking deer they feed with a different color non-toxic paint to indicate what day they were treated. The deer don't always cooperate: On Monday [24 Oct 2016], a doe and a young buck tried to lick off the paint. They're trying to come up with a better alternative, which can be tricky in the tightly regulated refuge that also caused some locals to complain the staff reacted too slowly to the initial outbreak. 'People asked what took you so long once this was diagnosed. But we have 23 endangered species. We have to balance protection and making sure we weren't hurting other animals,' Killam said. 'We wanted to make sure we didn't make a bigger problem.' [Byline: Jenny Staletovich] -- Communicated by: ProMED-mail ****** [3] Date: Wed 26 Oct 2016 From: Moisés Vargas-Terán [edited] Comments about the event, New World screwworm (NWS) that has occurred in Florida, USA, which are based on ProMED public briefing notes on 18, 20 and 22 Oct 2016: On 18 Oct 2016 the NWS had been detected in the following additional sites to Big Pine Key where it was detected originally: 1) No Name Keys, 2) Big Torch Key, 3) Middle Torch Key, 4) Cudjoe and 5) Ramrod. According to information available, NWS sterile flies produced by the Panama plant, United States Commission for the Eradication and Prevention of NWS, were to be released on 11 Oct 2016 by the dispersion on land method. If the occurrence of NWS is to be quickly and efficiently contained, you need to make an effort and use the proven aerial release method of sterile flies, especially because the population most affected is wild animals and sterile flies will have a better distribution over infested areas, which does not occur by the method of land release as access of insects is limited to the availability of roads and release points selected for this purpose. It is also recommended as a preventive measure the (creation) of biological barriers using NWS sterile flies at strategic locations in the area of the Keys and the mainland, until the occurrence in the affected areas is controlled. The current emergency demands that all human and economic resources are employed now, in order to avoid further negative health and economic impacts. Notes on 20 and 22 Oct 2016 refer to chemical control efforts to prevent and control seizures in adult NWS in the wild deer population. This is an important control measure associated with intensive field inspection of farm animals and pets. Also the application of physical measures, such as the use of a large number of fly traps for NWS, can be useful, while a communication campaign at the local, state or national levels (providing information) on NWS control. However, it should be noted that the above control measure will help reduce the wild population and its consequences, but not the elimination of the NWS. Proper use of the technique using sterile insects on this occasion, as in others, is the key to the successful elimination of NWS in Florida, USA. -- Moisés Vargas-Terán International Animal Health Specialist [I apologise for probably overloading with 2 similar reports out of Florida but they provide colour and details of the doramectin response and some excellent photographs for those needing material for briefing colleagues and instructing students.

'We have already asked the prosecutor for permission to carry out all necessary checks according to law.' V. Nagorny also said that at present his Service, together with the regional veterinary administration and law enforcement agencies, are engaged in determining the cause of the animal virus infection. According to him, there are several versions. Above all, penetration of the virus from countries where FMD is prevalent, such as Pakistan, Afghanistan and Turkey. He did not exclude the possible drift or spread of the virus from a Moscow plant, cultivating the virus strain for vaccine production. 'But our task is not necessarily to limit our investigations to a particular solitary version,' he said. V. Nagorny also said that introduction of the FMD virus by contaminated animal feed has been excluded. He explained that the animal feed sector in Vyshmanovo utilized locally grown ingredients for the production of the feed, but recently used also imported produce. 'The same feed was supplied and used in other farms without problems. The feed has also been tested negative for the virus. Thus, feed, as source of infection, can be excluded,' he said. According to the spokesman of Rosselkhoznadzor, Alex Alekseenko, it is now very important to determine the molecular structure of the virus. 'Identifying its closest strains will enable to define its origin and route of penetration,' he said. FMD was discovered last week in a farm in the village Vyshmanovo, Vladimir region. To date, all the livestock in it, about 800 head of cattle, have been destroyed. For security purposes, all the wooden buildings on the farm will be burned, and the concrete structures processed [which probably means cleansing by disinfectants or heat-treated by burners/torches]. All cattle in the area have been vaccinated. Meanwhile, the detection of FMD in the territory of the Russian Federation which had been recognized earlier this year [2016] by the OIE as a free zone without vaccination, can adversely affect the export plans of meat producers. Kazakhstan and Belarus have imposed a ban on meat imports from a number of regions of the Russian Federation (see item 1 above). -- Communicated by: ProMED-mail [The above report presents 2 issues which have been put to discussion in ProMED-mail's earlier postings addressing the FMDV Asia 1 event in Vladimir; their current presentation by Russian officials renders them significant. 1. The need to exclude a possibility that the outbreak could have been caused by a vaccine strain originating from a local vaccine producing plant; and 2. The 'importance to determine the molecular structure of the virus'; in other words, its genotyping. In fact, the said 2 issues are related to each other. Genotyping will allow the confirmation or exclusion of the raised possibility ('version') that a vaccine strain is behind the event. During a comparable 2007 event in the UK, 2 days elapsed between the initial report on a suspected case of 'a vesicular disease' affecting cattle 'at a premises in Surrey' (20070803.2509), and the official reporting of its final identification as the vaccine strain 'FMDV serotype 01 strain BFS67-1' (20070803.2523, 20070804.2538), found later to have leaked from the Pirbright laboratory, situated 6 km [about 4 miles] from the affected farm. According to available information (), killed FMD vaccines against serotype Asia 1 are produced in the following plants in Russia: Plant name / location / website ------------------------------- 1. Shchelkovsky Biocombinat / Moscow region / 2. Agrovet / Moscow / 3. FGBI - 'ARRIAH' (Federal Centre for Animal Health) / Vladimir, Tur'evets / The 3rd plant is situated less than 14 km [9 miles] from the affected farm (map at ). The genotyping is expected to be performed by the highly qualified FMD laboratory of FGBI - 'ARRIAH'. OIE gave 2 international statuses to this laboratory: OIE Regional Reference Laboratory for Foot-and-Mouth Disease (1995) and OIE Collaborating Centre for Diagnosis and Control of Animal Diseases for Eastern Europe, Central Asia and Transcaucasia (1997). FAO gave a status of FAO Reference Centre for Foot-and-Mouth Disease for Central Asia and Western Eurasia to the FGBI 'ARRIAH' (2013). It is expected that the vaccine strains from each of the 3 named producers be included in the battery of virus strains compared with the strain sampled from clinical FMD cases on the premises of the affected dairy operation in Vyshmanovo. It may be assumed that the molecular studies of the causative pathogen have been initiated during the earliest stages of the event.

A., Abdrakhmanov, S. K., Abdybekova, A. M., Karatayev, B. S., & Torgerson, P. R. (2016), published in PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases. The complete article is available at . 'This study demonstrates that in Kazakhstan there is a substantial economic cost and health impact of rabies. These costs could be reduced by modifying the vaccination programme that is now practised. The study also fills some data gaps on the epidemiology and economic effects of rabies in respect to Kazakhstan. Rabies is a fatal viral zoonotic disease largely transmitted to humans from bites by infected animals. Rabies is currently registered in over 100 countries in all continents except Australia and Antarctica. The disease is characterized by neuroencephalitis with 100 perfect case fatality ratio once clinical signs present. Over 55 000 people and over 1 million animals die from rabies annually throughout the world. Direct losses from rabies amount to over EURO 4 billion each year. Human rabies presents a serious public health threat in Kazakhstan. It is a reportable disease and public health data is available to quantify numbers of cases. Kazakhstan is an upper middle income country. Previous published data suggested that between 2007 and 2011, 44 cases of human rabies were recorded or a mean of 9 cases per year. Of these, 40 were the result of contact with dogs, 3 cases from contact with cats and 1 case from a fox. The incidence of dog bites was reported as 3700 per million population in 2010 and 4130 per million population in 2011. Post exposure prophylaxis was given to 57 000 individuals in 2009, 59 000 in 2010 and 67 000 in 2011. Like many endemic countries, animal rabies is registered annually within Kazakhstan. There is also a programme of vaccination of domestic dogs, cats and agricultural animals and a limited programme to vaccinate foxes through the distribution of vaccine impregnated baits. However a reduction in the disease incidence in animals has not been observed. Thus, one of the objectives of this study was to better understand the epidemiology of rabies by examining the geographical distribution of rabies amongst animals in the country and to evaluate control measures. The economic and disease burden of rabies has also not been previously estimated specifically for Kazakhstan, although estimates, based on modelling, are available from the global burden of rabies study (GBR). Surveillance data on the number of cases of human rabies, the incidence of animal bites and the numbers of individuals undergoing post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) were used to obtain more precise estimates of the burden of disease. In addition, data from the number of bites received from confirmed rabid animals was used to estimate the burden of disease avoided by the use of PEP and its cost effectiveness. Finally the economic effects of the disease was estimated from the costs of the animal vaccination programme, the costs of control of potentially rabid animals, the costs of PEP, the loss of income through premature death and the cost of livestock lost to rabies.'

They found that the rice fields they surveyed showed a significant loss of production caused by the rice root nematode. 'Every root we looked at had lesions,' Eisenback said. The culprit was a parasitic nematode called _Hirschmanniella mucronata_. 'Rice roots should be creamy white. These were speckled with brown and orange lesions.' He expects that these nematodes could cause a 20 to 30 per cent crop loss. Half the fields should be treated with nematicide to measure the effect. He also hopes to see what other nematodes are there. 'I would suspect that there are fields with other nematode problems.' -- Communicated by: Dr G Jackson Moderator, PestNet [A number of nematode pathogens are known to affect rice, including the rice root nematodes (RRN) _Hirschmanniella oryzae_ and other species in the genus. Infested roots show discolouration and are partially hollow and nematode feeding adversely affects absorption of water and nutrients. Plants are yellow and stunted, with reduced tillers. Serious crop losses due to rice root nematodes have been reported, for example from Asia. The pathogens may be spread with soil, water, and with contaminated equipment. Once soil nematodes have been established in an area, it is difficult to control or eradicate them. Disease management requires an integrated approach including phytosanitary and cultural measures (crop rotation), chemical nematicides, or biocontrol agents.

West Nile virus (WNV) is a member of the genus _Flavivirus_ in the family _Flaviviridae_. The arbovirus is maintained in nature by cycling through birds and mosquitoes; numerous avian and mosquito species support virus replication. For many avian species, WNV infection causes no overt signs while other birds, such as American crows (_Corvus brachyrhynchos_) and blue jays (_Cyanocitta cristata_), often succumb to fatal systemic illness. Among mammals, clinical disease is primarily exhibited in horses and humans () West Nile viruses have been found throughout much of the world including Africa, Europe, Asia, the Middle East, Australia, the Americas, and the Caribbean. In some regions, the viruses do not seem to be endemic, but are reintroduced regularly by migratory wild birds. These viruses may either cause outbreaks, or circulate asymptomatically among birds during warm weather, and disappear with the onset of cold temperatures.

Leptospirosis is caused by a corkscrew-shaped bacterium called _Leptospira interrogans_, is often referred to as 'rat fever' due to the principal role rats play in spreading the disease (scientists refer this type of animal as a reservoir host). Other animals can also be important reservoirs of the disease. These animals can spread the disease in their urine, contaminating water, soil, or food. People who live in close contact with domestic animals or wildlife are at higher risk for getting the disease. People become infected by coming into contact with contaminated urine, water, food, or soil through breaks in the skin, eyes, mouth, or nose. Outbreaks of leptospirosis are usually caused by exposure to contaminated water, such as floodwaters. Person to person transmission is rare. Infected individuals initially experience fever, severe headache and muscle aches, abdominal pain, and occasionally a skin rash. Patients in the later stages of disease can suffer from jaundice, kidney failure, bleeding from the mouth or nose, bloody urine and can be fatal, especially without proper treatment.

The H5N8 virus is not as disastrous as H5N1, the variety found during the bird flu outbreak [in Kerala] in 2014, said Animal Husbandry Department Director NN Sasi. The virus might have been carried by migratory birds, he said. The Collector said there would be restrictions on movement of ducks in the district for the next 10 days. There will be random checks at meat sales outlets. There is no harm in consumption of eggs or meat of unaffected birds. The virus is not transmitted from bird to human beings. In case people in close contact with the affected birds develop symptoms of fever, they should consult the doctor. If symptoms of the virus attack are found among poultry birds, the matter should be reported to Animal Husbandry Department officials.

A previous government press release, by India's Ministry of Agriculture, was published on 21 Oct 2016. It reported the initial and 1st confirmation (in non-poultry birds) of the avian influenza H5N8 virus in India. This information was kindly submitted to ProMED-mail from ICAR-National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases (OIE Reference Laboratory for Avian Influenza), Anandnagar, Bhopal (see archive no. 20161021.4576300). The initial information referred to the mortality of wild (not captive) birds in the National Zoological Park (NZP), New Delhi, which had started on 14 Oct 2016. Until 17 Oct 2016, 9 birds had died: 5 rosy pelican (_Pelecanus onocrotalus_), 3 (wild) ducks, and one painted stork (_Mycteria leucocephala_). On 18 Oct 2016, the Delhi Zoo was closed by the authorities. On 21 Oct 2016, samples were received from the Gandhi Zoological Park, Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh state, where 15 painted storks were found infected by the H5N8 virus strain. The Ministry of Agriculture press release () indicated that according to OIE's Terrestrial Code, 'avian Influenza disease in wild/migratory birds does not affect the status of the country; hence there are no trade implications.' The current cases in a 3rd Indian state, Kerala, involve domestic ducks, which are defined in the Code as 'poultry'. Notification to the OIE is anticipated. The H5N8 virus strain has never been reported in India. During 2015, H5N8 HPAI was reported from several countries in North America, Europe, and Asia, in wild and domestic birds, while, in 2016, it has occurred in the Russian Federation, in Taiwan, in the Republic of Korea and, now, in India. The Indian territory is included in the southern part of the Central Asian Flyway. Before the recent events, since 2006, only H5N1 HPAI had been detected on an annual basis, affecting both wild and domestic birds. The latest available information on H5 clades circulating in India is from 2015, when 2.3.2.1a and 2.3.2.1c were isolated. Given the fact that a new strain was detected in the country, more details on its genetic characterization are awaited to better understand the possible source of this event. FAO EMPRES Watch Vol 35 of Sep 2016 included an assessment of the potential for international spread by wild/migratory birds of HPAI H5N8 of clade 2.3.4.4 (see archive no. 20160920.4501532 and ).

Clinical signs began [18 Oct 2016]. No animals have left the facility since clinical signs began. This is the 4th case in Miami-Dade County and the 21st case for Florida in 2016. Strangles poses no risk to humans, but is highly contagious and common among horses. Strangles is caused by infection with _Streptococcus equi_ subspecies _equi_. Symptoms include fever, diminished appetite, nasal discharge (that begins clear and turns purulent) and enlarged submandibular lymph nodes that can become abscessed. It is in the obstructed breathing caused by enlarged lymph nodes and in rare cases death by suffocation that the disease received its name. In most cases, infection with _S. equi self-resolves, but this disease has a death rate of about 10 percent, usually from complications involving spread beyond the head and neck, including pneumonia. Transmission occurs by direct contact between animals and via fomites or water sources. Treatment can include chemotherapy with antibiotics if initiated in the very early stage of the disease or as post-exposure prophylaxis; otherwise, initiation of antibiotic treatment is not recommended due to evidence that it can prolong infection or inhibit formation of post-infection immunity. As about 20 percent of cases become asymptomatic nasal carriers, vaccination is the considered the best method of control.

Euro Surveill. 2016; 21(43): pii=30381 ------------------------------ Abstract -------- Real-world estimates of seasonal influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) are important for early detection of vaccine failure. We developed a method for evaluating real-time in-season vaccine effectiveness (IVE) and overall seasonal VE. In a retrospective, register-based, cohort study including all 2 million individuals in Stockholm County, Sweden, during the influenza seasons from 2011/12 to 2014/15, vaccination status was obtained from Stockholm's vaccine register. Main outcomes were hospitalisation or primary care visits for influenza (International Classification of Disease (ICD)-10 codes J09-J11). VE was assessed using Cox multivariate stratified and non-stratified analyses adjusting for age, sex, socioeconomic status, comorbidities and previous influenza vaccinations. Stratified analyses showed moderate VE in prevention of influenza hospitalisations among chronically ill adults 65 years and older in 2 of 4 seasons, and lower but still significant VE in one season; 53 percent (95 percent confidence interval (CI): 33-67) in 2012/13, 55 percent (95 percent CI: 25-73) in 2013/14 and 18 percent (95 percent CI: 3-31) in 2014/15. In conclusion, seasonal influenza vaccination was associated with substantial reductions in influenza-specific hospitalisation, particularly in adults 65 years and older with underlying chronic conditions. With the use of population-based patient register data on influenza-specific outcomes, it will be possible to obtain real-time estimates of seasonal influenza VE. -- Communicated by: ProMED-mail [Annual vaccination against circulating influenza viruses remains the best strategy for preventing illness from influenza. A clear challenge, however, is that vaccine effectiveness (VE) varies from year to year [1]. These variations may be related to differences in antigenic match between the vaccine and the circulating strains, the immune status of those who are being vaccinated, or the time interval between vaccination and influenza outbreaks. The authors of the above study concluded that overall VE for inpatient and outpatient care was 19 percent, while it was 40 percent during the 2012/13 season, particularly in inpatients over 65 years of age. A similar trend was reflected in the 2013/14 season, but VE was much lower than in the last 2 seasons, at 18 percent. The study also concludes that for the 2 seasons with moderately high VEs, percentages in inpatients with comorbidities were similar to those of the whole population. Stratified analyses on previous season influenza vaccination among those 65 years of age or older showed no clear effects, either protective or negative, against the risk of being hospitalised with a diagnosis of influenza in the current season. Based on evaluation of multiple vaccine seasons, the authors claim to show substantial protective VE against being hospitalised with a 'clinical' diagnosis of influenza among elderly and chronically ill persons in all age groups during 2 of 4 seasons. However, the conclusions have not been based on data supporting reduction of disease burden or disease transmission or any analysis of influenza-associated mortality in vaccinated versus unvaccinated populations stratified by age groups. For relevant information on different methodologies that can be used to estimate influenza vaccine coverage at national levels among high-risk groups targeted for vaccination based on estimated numerator and denominator data, a comprehensive document published by the World Health Organization is also available [2]. The study recommendation for focusing public health resources towards higher coverage rates in people with underlying diseases is also supported by work of other groups [3]. Reference --------- 1.

The respiratory specimen was collected as part of routine influenza surveillance activities. The next day, CDC was notified of a child aged 9 years who was a swine exhibitor at an agricultural fair in Michigan who became ill on 29 Jul 2016 and tested positive for H3N2v virus at the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services Laboratory. Investigations by Michigan and Ohio health authorities identified 18 human infections linked to swine exhibits at agricultural fairs. To minimize transmission of influenza viruses from infected swine to visitors, agricultural fair organizers should consider prevention measures such as shortening the time swine are on the fairgrounds, isolating ill swine, maintaining a veterinarian on call, providing handwashing stations, and prohibiting food and beverages in animal barns. Persons at high risk for influenza-associated complications should be discouraged from entering swine barns. -- Communicated by: ProMED-mail [Including the infections described in this report, 372 H3N2v virus infections have been reported in the United States since 2005; this report describes all reported H3N2v virus infections in the United States since 1 Jan 2016. This report underscores the importance of implementing measures to minimize influenza transmission between swine and persons at agricultural fairs. Young persons who exhibit or have other direct contact with swine should be educated on how to protect themselves from infection, as most infections in this and previous outbreaks have been in persons aged under 18 years who had direct contact with swine. This can be done through messages about the variant influenza virus transmission risk and prevention, particularly among young persons and persons at increased risk for influenza-associated complications (children aged under 5 years, persons aged 65 years or older, pregnant women, and persons with certain health conditions) to the agricultural fair organizers and officials, fair attendees, and animal exhibitors. Treatment with a neuraminidase inhibitor is recommended for persons with suspected variant virus infection who are hospitalized, who have severe or progressive illness, or who are in a group at high risk for influenza-associated complications. Human seasonal influenza vaccine is not known to protect against commonly circulating swine-origin influenza viruses, but it can protect against seasonal influenza, which can circulate even during summer months, when most fairs occur. An annual seasonal influenza vaccine, which is recommended for all persons aged 6 months and older, might help prevent future reassortment of H3N2v viruses with human seasonal influenza viruses.

The UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) said earlier this week that it is on the ground in the hardest hit areas chlorinating water sources, distributing hygiene kits and teaching families about prevention. A cholera outbreak across Yemen is the last thing the conflict-ridden country needed, but it was also expected, given the collapse of the health system.

Roach RR, Greydanus DE, Patel DR, Homnick DN, Merrick J (eds), 2014, Nova Science Publishers, 2015, oral rehydration therapy can be life-saving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea: 'As reviewed by Richard Guerrant and colleagues (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, references 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant (1) highlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 per cent to 3.6 per cent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as 'potentially the most important medical advance' of the 20th century.

Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation.'

Compared to the same period in 2015, 12 269 cases of cholera with 192 deaths were reported. 8838 cases and 476 cholera-related deaths (fatality rate 2%) were reported in the 8 epidemical provinces of the Congo river basin (Nord Ubangui, Sud Ubangui, Équateur, Tshopo, Mongala, Maniema, Mai-Ndombe et Kinshasa) where 660 000 people are currently at risk of cholera, including 316 800 children aged 0-14 years old. In the Central African Republic, the transmission of the epidemic, declared on 10 Aug 2016, has slowed down. 13 cases were confirmed to have originated in the DRC. A cholera alert has been ongoing since 11 Sep 2016 by the sanitation authority of the Republic of Congo: 16 cases of cholera and 3 deaths were found on Mbamou Island, Brazzaville. The response coming from the Congo River is hindered by limited access, the absence of a surveillance system and appropriate security, a lack of community resilience, and limited local knowledge on subjects of prevention and intervention. The epidemic is already present in Kinshasa, the densely populated capital of the DRC, situated along the Congo River. With its sanitary installations, rudimentary water supply, and arrival of cases onboard boats, the epidemic could rapidly propagate itself and put millions in danger. -- Communicated by: ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts [The HealthMap/ProMED maps can be found at: for the DR Congo: for the Central African Republic: and for the Republic of Congo: - Mod.MPP] ****** [2] Cholera - Uganda (Amuru District) Date: Fri 28 Oct 2016 Source: The Monitor [edited] At least 2 people have died of cholera in Amuru District, with cases registered rising to 40 patients since the outbreak of the epidemic in September 2016, according to statistics from the district health officials.

'In total, 23 people were affected in the region (rural Bella); 6 of them died. The remaining 17 patients were admitted to hospitals, and 3 of them later died,' said Mainasara to government radio. The 1st case was identified on 13 Oct 2016, when a 16-year-old was admitted to hospital after suffering disease symptoms, such as abdominal pain, diarrhea and vomiting. The young man died the day after admission.

The Yemeni Ministry of Public Health has reported 6 laboratory confirmed deaths related to cholera in Sana'a, Aden and Ibb, Dujarric said at a daily news briefing here. WHO is estimating that 7.6 million people are living in affected and at-risk areas, he said. 'There are delays in confirming the suspected cases of cholera since there are only 2 laboratories in the country, one in Sana'a and one in Aden,' the spokesman said. 'Humanitarian partners continue to provide people with water supplies in the affected areas and improve water infrastructure,' he added. A cholera outbreak in Yemen has put an even greater strain on the country's already fractured health system. The UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) said earlier this week that it is on the ground in the hardest hit areas chlorinating water sources, distributing hygiene kits and teaching families about prevention. A cholera outbreak across Yemen is the last thing the conflict-ridden country needed, but it was also expected, given the collapse of the health system. More than 600 health facilities are not functioning, and many of those that are functioning are either poorly staffed or are running on minimum operating capacity. -- Communicated by: ProMED-mail [The HealthMap/ProMED map of Yemen can be found at: . - Mod.MPP] ****** [5] Cholera - Philippines (Negros Occidental Province) Date: Thu 27 Oct 2016 Source: The Visayan Daily Star [edited] The Bacolod City Health Office has declared a cholera outbreak in Handumanan Elementary School 1 in Bacolod City after 10 out of the more than 100 students affected by food and waterborne disease tested positive for cholera. Dr. Grace Tan, CHO Environmental Sanitation Division head, said they are taking steps to prevent the disease from spreading. As of yesterday [26 Oct 2016], however, no additional cases of cholera were noted in HES 1. Out of the 10 affected by cholera, one was an adult, she said. Tan said that all the 129 students affected by the food and waterborne disease in HES 1 have already been discharged from the different hospitals where they had been confined between 14 and 17 Oct 2016. They are consolidating the records since there were children affected by food and waterborne disease who had not been accounted for, since they were only treated at home and did not pass through the health centers. They could all be accounted for when they return to school in November 2016, she said.

Compared to the same period in 2015, 12 269 cases of cholera with 192 deaths were reported. 8838 cases and 476 cholera-related deaths (fatality rate 2%) were reported in the 8 epidemical provinces of the Congo river basin (Nord Ubangui, Sud Ubangui, Équateur, Tshopo, Mongala, Maniema, Mai-Ndombe et Kinshasa) where 660 000 people are currently at risk of cholera, including 316 800 children aged 0-14 years old. In the Central African Republic, the transmission of the epidemic, declared on 10 Aug 2016, has slowed down. 13 cases were confirmed to have originated in the DRC. A cholera alert has been ongoing since 11 Sep 2016 by the sanitation authority of the Republic of Congo: 16 cases of cholera and 3 deaths were found on Mbamou Island, Brazzaville. The response coming from the Congo River is hindered by limited access, the absence of a surveillance system and appropriate security, a lack of community resilience, and limited local knowledge on subjects of prevention and intervention. The epidemic is already present in Kinshasa, the densely populated capital of the DRC, situated along the Congo River. With its sanitary installations, rudimentary water supply, and arrival of cases onboard boats, the epidemic could rapidly propagate itself and put millions in danger. -- Communicated by: ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts [The HealthMap/ProMED maps can be found at: for the DR Congo: for the Central African Republic: and for the Republic of Congo: - Mod.MPP] ****** [2] Cholera - Uganda (Amuru District) Date: Fri 28 Oct 2016 Source: The Monitor [edited] At least 2 people have died of cholera in Amuru District, with cases registered rising to 40 patients since the outbreak of the epidemic in September 2016, according to statistics from the district health officials.

'In total, 23 people were affected in the region (rural Bella); 6 of them died. The remaining 17 patients were admitted to hospitals, and 3 of them later died,' said Mainasara to government radio. The 1st case was identified on 13 Oct 2016, when a 16-year-old was admitted to hospital after suffering disease symptoms, such as abdominal pain, diarrhea and vomiting. The young man died the day after admission.

The Yemeni Ministry of Public Health has reported 6 laboratory confirmed deaths related to cholera in Sana'a, Aden and Ibb, Dujarric said at a daily news briefing here. WHO is estimating that 7.6 million people are living in affected and at-risk areas, he said. 'There are delays in confirming the suspected cases of cholera since there are only 2 laboratories in the country, one in Sana'a and one in Aden,' the spokesman said. 'Humanitarian partners continue to provide people with water supplies in the affected areas and improve water infrastructure,' he added. A cholera outbreak in Yemen has put an even greater strain on the country's already fractured health system. The UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) said earlier this week that it is on the ground in the hardest hit areas chlorinating water sources, distributing hygiene kits and teaching families about prevention. A cholera outbreak across Yemen is the last thing the conflict-ridden country needed, but it was also expected, given the collapse of the health system. More than 600 health facilities are not functioning, and many of those that are functioning are either poorly staffed or are running on minimum operating capacity. -- Communicated by: ProMED-mail [The HealthMap/ProMED map of Yemen can be found at: . - Mod.MPP] ****** [5] Cholera - Philippines (Negros Occidental Province) Date: Thu 27 Oct 2016 Source: The Visayan Daily Star [edited] The Bacolod City Health Office has declared a cholera outbreak in Handumanan Elementary School 1 in Bacolod City after 10 out of the more than 100 students affected by food and waterborne disease tested positive for cholera. Dr. Grace Tan, CHO Environmental Sanitation Division head, said they are taking steps to prevent the disease from spreading. As of yesterday [26 Oct 2016], however, no additional cases of cholera were noted in HES 1. Out of the 10 affected by cholera, one was an adult, she said. Tan said that all the 129 students affected by the food and waterborne disease in HES 1 have already been discharged from the different hospitals where they had been confined between 14 and 17 Oct 2016. They are consolidating the records since there were children affected by food and waterborne disease who had not been accounted for, since they were only treated at home and did not pass through the health centers. They could all be accounted for when they return to school in November 2016, she said.

Compared to the same period in 2015, 12 269 cases of cholera with 192 deaths were reported. 8838 cases and 476 cholera-related deaths (fatality rate 2%) were reported in the 8 epidemical provinces of the Congo river basin (Nord Ubangui, Sud Ubangui, Équateur, Tshopo, Mongala, Maniema, Mai-Ndombe et Kinshasa) where 660 000 people are currently at risk of cholera, including 316 800 children aged 0-14 years old. In the Central African Republic, the transmission of the epidemic, declared on 10 Aug 2016, has slowed down. 13 cases were confirmed to have originated in the DRC. A cholera alert has been ongoing since 11 Sep 2016 by the sanitation authority of the Republic of Congo: 16 cases of cholera and 3 deaths were found on Mbamou Island, Brazzaville. The response coming from the Congo River is hindered by limited access, the absence of a surveillance system and appropriate security, a lack of community resilience, and limited local knowledge on subjects of prevention and intervention. The epidemic is already present in Kinshasa, the densely populated capital of the DRC, situated along the Congo River. With its sanitary installations, rudimentary water supply, and arrival of cases onboard boats, the epidemic could rapidly propagate itself and put millions in danger. -- Communicated by: ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts [The HealthMap/ProMED maps can be found at: for the DR Congo: for the Central African Republic: and for the Republic of Congo: - Mod.MPP] ****** [2] Cholera - Uganda (Amuru District) Date: Fri 28 Oct 2016 Source: The Monitor [edited] At least 2 people have died of cholera in Amuru District, with cases registered rising to 40 patients since the outbreak of the epidemic in September 2016, according to statistics from the district health officials. The in-charge of Bibia Health Centre III in Atiak Sub-county, Ms Susan Aromorach, said the latest case registered was on 22 Oct 2016, when 4 people were admitted to the facility. Ms Aromorach said that among the 4 patients who had been admitted, 2 were children, and they have since been discharged, while one person is still admitted in the isolation ward. -- Communicated by: ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts [The HealthMap/ProMED map of Uganda can be found at: . - Mod.MPP] ****** [3] Cholera - Niger (Dosso Region) Date: Thu 27 Oct 2016 Source: Life and Style [machine trans. edited] At least 9 people died in the last 2 weeks, and another 14 were treated in hospitals because of the cholera epidemic in a rural area in the Dosso region in southern Niger, the Nigerian Minister of Health, Idi Mainasara, reported today, 27 Oct 2016. 'In total, 23 people were affected in the region (rural Bella); 6 of them died. The remaining 17 patients were admitted to hospitals, and 3 of them later died,' said Mainasara to government radio. The 1st case was identified on 13 Oct 2016, when a 16-year-old was admitted to hospital after suffering disease symptoms, such as abdominal pain, diarrhea and vomiting. The young man died the day after admission. 'On 16 Oct 2016, 4 other villagers in the area died after suffering the same clinical signs of the disease,' said Mainasara. -- Communicated by: ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts [The HealthMap/ProMED map of Niger can be found at: . - Mod.MPP] ***** [4] Cholera - Yemen Date: Fri 28 Oct 2016 Source: Xin Hua [edited] The WHO has reported 51 confirmed cases of cholera from 9 governorates in Yemen, with more than 1180 suspected cases, UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters here on Thu 27 Oct 2016. The Yemeni Ministry of Public Health has reported 6 laboratory confirmed deaths related to cholera in Sana'a, Aden and Ibb, Dujarric said at a daily news briefing here. WHO is estimating that 7.6 million people are living in affected and at-risk areas, he said. 'There are delays in confirming the suspected cases of cholera since there are only 2 laboratories in the country, one in Sana'a and one in Aden,' the spokesman said. 'Humanitarian partners continue to provide people with water supplies in the affected areas and improve water infrastructure,' he added. A cholera outbreak in Yemen has put an even greater strain on the country's already fractured health system. The UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) said earlier this week that it is on the ground in the hardest hit areas chlorinating water sources, distributing hygiene kits and teaching families about prevention. A cholera outbreak across Yemen is the last thing the conflict-ridden country needed, but it was also expected, given the collapse of the health system. More than 600 health facilities are not functioning, and many of those that are functioning are either poorly staffed or are running on minimum operating capacity. -- Communicated by: ProMED-mail [The HealthMap/ProMED map of Yemen can be found at: . - Mod.MPP] ****** [5] Cholera - Philippines (Negros Occidental Province) Date: Thu 27 Oct 2016 Source: The Visayan Daily Star [edited] The Bacolod City Health Office has declared a cholera outbreak in Handumanan Elementary School 1 in Bacolod City after 10 out of the more than 100 students affected by food and waterborne disease tested positive for cholera. Dr. Grace Tan, CHO Environmental Sanitation Division head, said they are taking steps to prevent the disease from spreading. As of yesterday [26 Oct 2016], however, no additional cases of cholera were noted in HES 1. Out of the 10 affected by cholera, one was an adult, she said. Tan said that all the 129 students affected by the food and waterborne disease in HES 1 have already been discharged from the different hospitals where they had been confined between 14 and 17 Oct 2016. They are consolidating the records since there were children affected by food and waterborne disease who had not been accounted for, since they were only treated at home and did not pass through the health centers. They could all be accounted for when they return to school in November 2016, she said.

Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation.'

Compared to the same period in 2015, 12 269 cases of cholera with 192 deaths were reported. 8838 cases and 476 cholera-related deaths (fatality rate 2%) were reported in the 8 epidemical provinces of the Congo river basin (Nord Ubangui, Sud Ubangui, Équateur, Tshopo, Mongala, Maniema, Mai-Ndombe et Kinshasa) where 660 000 people are currently at risk of cholera, including 316 800 children aged 0-14 years old. In the Central African Republic, the transmission of the epidemic, declared on 10 Aug 2016, has slowed down. 13 cases were confirmed to have originated in the DRC. A cholera alert has been ongoing since 11 Sep 2016 by the sanitation authority of the Republic of Congo: 16 cases of cholera and 3 deaths were found on Mbamou Island, Brazzaville. The response coming from the Congo River is hindered by limited access, the absence of a surveillance system and appropriate security, a lack of community resilience, and limited local knowledge on subjects of prevention and intervention. The epidemic is already present in Kinshasa, the densely populated capital of the DRC, situated along the Congo River. With its sanitary installations, rudimentary water supply, and arrival of cases onboard boats, the epidemic could rapidly propagate itself and put millions in danger. -- Communicated by: ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts [The HealthMap/ProMED maps can be found at: for the DR Congo: for the Central African Republic: and for the Republic of Congo: - Mod.MPP] ****** [2] Cholera - Uganda (Amuru District) Date: Fri 28 Oct 2016 Source: The Monitor [edited] At least 2 people have died of cholera in Amuru District, with cases registered rising to 40 patients since the outbreak of the epidemic in September 2016, according to statistics from the district health officials. The in-charge of Bibia Health Centre III in Atiak Sub-county, Ms Susan Aromorach, said the latest case registered was on 22 Oct 2016, when 4 people were admitted to the facility. Ms Aromorach said that among the 4 patients who had been admitted, 2 were children, and they have since been discharged, while one person is still admitted in the isolation ward. -- Communicated by: ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts [The HealthMap/ProMED map of Uganda can be found at: . - Mod.MPP] ****** [3] Cholera - Niger (Dosso Region) Date: Thu 27 Oct 2016 Source: Life and Style [machine trans. edited] At least 9 people died in the last 2 weeks, and another 14 were treated in hospitals because of the cholera epidemic in a rural area in the Dosso region in southern Niger, the Nigerian Minister of Health, Idi Mainasara, reported today, 27 Oct 2016. 'In total, 23 people were affected in the region (rural Bella); 6 of them died. The remaining 17 patients were admitted to hospitals, and 3 of them later died,' said Mainasara to government radio. The 1st case was identified on 13 Oct 2016, when a 16-year-old was admitted to hospital after suffering disease symptoms, such as abdominal pain, diarrhea and vomiting. The young man died the day after admission. 'On 16 Oct 2016, 4 other villagers in the area died after suffering the same clinical signs of the disease,' said Mainasara. -- Communicated by: ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts [The HealthMap/ProMED map of Niger can be found at: . - Mod.MPP] ***** [4] Cholera - Yemen Date: Fri 28 Oct 2016 Source: Xin Hua [edited] The WHO has reported 51 confirmed cases of cholera from 9 governorates in Yemen, with more than 1180 suspected cases, UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters here on Thu 27 Oct 2016. The Yemeni Ministry of Public Health has reported 6 laboratory confirmed deaths related to cholera in Sana'a, Aden and Ibb, Dujarric said at a daily news briefing here. WHO is estimating that 7.6 million people are living in affected and at-risk areas, he said. 'There are delays in confirming the suspected cases of cholera since there are only 2 laboratories in the country, one in Sana'a and one in Aden,' the spokesman said. 'Humanitarian partners continue to provide people with water supplies in the affected areas and improve water infrastructure,' he added. A cholera outbreak in Yemen has put an even greater strain on the country's already fractured health system. The UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) said earlier this week that it is on the ground in the hardest hit areas chlorinating water sources, distributing hygiene kits and teaching families about prevention. A cholera outbreak across Yemen is the last thing the conflict-ridden country needed, but it was also expected, given the collapse of the health system. More than 600 health facilities are not functioning, and many of those that are functioning are either poorly staffed or are running on minimum operating capacity. -- Communicated by: ProMED-mail [The HealthMap/ProMED map of Yemen can be found at: . - Mod.MPP] ****** [5] Cholera - Philippines (Negros Occidental Province) Date: Thu 27 Oct 2016 Source: The Visayan Daily Star [edited] The Bacolod City Health Office has declared a cholera outbreak in Handumanan Elementary School 1 in Bacolod City after 10 out of the more than 100 students affected by food and waterborne disease tested positive for cholera. Dr. Grace Tan, CHO Environmental Sanitation Division head, said they are taking steps to prevent the disease from spreading. As of yesterday [26 Oct 2016], however, no additional cases of cholera were noted in HES 1. Out of the 10 affected by cholera, one was an adult, she said. Tan said that all the 129 students affected by the food and waterborne disease in HES 1 have already been discharged from the different hospitals where they had been confined between 14 and 17 Oct 2016. They are consolidating the records since there were children affected by food and waterborne disease who had not been accounted for, since they were only treated at home and did not pass through the health centers. They could all be accounted for when they return to school in November 2016, she said.

As cited in Lutwick LI, Preis J: Cholera. In: Tropical pediatrics. Roach RR, Greydanus DE, Patel DR, Homnick DN, Merrick J (eds), 2014, Nova Science Publishers, 2015, oral rehydration therapy can be life-saving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea: 'As reviewed by Richard Guerrant and colleagues (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, references 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant (1) highlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 per cent to 3.6 per cent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as 'potentially the most important medical advance' of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose- or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5). 'The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in reference 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 ml/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation.'

The number of reported syphilis cases in Lane County spiked from 2014 to 2015. An even higher total is expected in 2016, prompting public health officials to make broader education efforts. The number of cases more than doubled from 21 in 2014 to 59 in 2015, said Jason Davis, spokesman for Lane County Public Health. This year [2016], 41 cases have been reported through 6 Oct 2016, putting the county on pace to exceed last year's figure, he said. Most of the cases were in the Eugene-Springfield area, but 'we're also seeing cases in Florence and Cottage Grove,' Davis said. Of the 41 cases, 23 were men and 18 were women, and most of the patients were 20 to 29 years old, Davis said. This trend is troubling, Lane County Health Officer Dr. Patrick Luedtke said. 'Up until 2012, we could expect a small, easily trackable number of cases that were confined primarily to men who have sex with men, but what this information shows is that our new average is in the double digits and spread nearly equally between men and women,' he said. 'This creates the potential for the disease to increase its footprint within our communities and infect more people at an ever increasing rate.' The main reason the disease is spreading is unprotected sex; people are having vaginal, oral or anal sex without using a condom, Lane County Public Health officials said. In Lane County, 62 percent of men who have sex with men aren't practicing safe sex, Davis said. 'Because so many STDs are manageable and curable, people have a lax attitude toward safe sex,' he said. Lack of access to medical services, such as testing, and inadequate communication between health care providers and patients about the patient's sexual history also are factors, public health officials said. Syphilis can have dire health consequences if left untreated. Syphilis, a bacterial infection, generally progresses through 3 stages, according to the Oregon Health Authority. It 1st shows itself as a painless sore on the penis, vagina, anus, or inside the mouth or rectum within a few weeks after infection. While the sore is healing, or several weeks after it has healed, a non-itchy rash may affect all or part of the body. Often red or brownish-red spots appear on the patient's palms and soles. In the 3rd stage of the disease, patients might not have any symptoms, increasing the risk of them spreading it to others, public health officials said. Syphilis can be treated with antibiotics. If left untreated, syphilis can lead to difficulty coordinating muscle movements, paralysis, numbness, blindness, dementia, damage to internal organs, and death. Lane County Public Health is launching an informational campaign to increase public awareness about syphilis. It will align its education efforts with other community health providers, such as HIV Alliance and Planned Parenthood, Davis said. Through public service announcements and ads, Lane County Public Health will direct people to the website syphaware.org, which was developed by the Oregon Health Authority. The website lays out information about how to prevent, identify and get treatment for syphilis. Chief Health Officer Dr. Patrick Luedtke will have conversations with area health care providers about how to talk with patients about their sexual history, how to recognize symptoms of syphilis, and how to report these cases, Davis said. Cases of syphilis in Lane County are on the rise: 2010 - 2 cases; 2011 - 1 case; 2012 - 8 cases; 2013 - 20 cases; 2014 - 21 cases; 2015 - 59 cases; and 2016 - 41 [cases so far].

In December 2014, the Food and Drug Administration granted the 1st-ever Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments waiver for a rapid treponemal syphilis screening test, Syphilis Health Check (SHC) (1). SHC is a new tool for public health programs to combat increasing syphilis rates, specifically among persons without a prior syphilis infection. SHC can be performed by nonlaboratorian health care personnel and results are available in 10 minutes. In 2015, a total of 7094 noncongenital cases of syphilis (35.8 case per 100,000) were reported to the Florida Department of Health (2). The Florida Department of Health evaluated the performance of SHC in comparison with treponemal and nontreponemal tests routinely used in its sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinic in Escambia County. For this evaluation, patients seeking STD testing at the Florida Department of Health STD clinic in Escambia County during 11 March 21-April 2016 were tested for syphilis using the SHC on blood specimens obtained by fingerstick; a venous blood specimen was drawn concurrently and submitted for treponemal (Trep-Sure), and nontreponemal (Arlington Scientific, Inc. [ASI] rapid plasma reagin [RPR] card test for syphilis) testing at the state public health laboratory. The state public health laboratory in Florida uses the CDC-recommended algorithm for syphilis testing (i.e., nontreponemal testing followed by treponemal testing for persons with a reactive nontreponemal test); however, for the purpose of this study, all collected specimens underwent treponemal testing regardless of the nontreponemal test result. The SHC result was compared with results of routine syphilis testing using the traditional testing algorithm at the state laboratory. Sensitivity, specificity, and overall laboratory test agreement were determined using the Trep-Sure qualitative enzyme immunoassay (EIA) reference treponemal test as the standard for 'true' positive or negative treponemal test results. The SHC was used to screen 202 patients for syphilis. Among these patients, 171 (85%) were nonreactive on all syphilis tests (SHC, EIA, and RPR), 26 (13%) had a reactive SHC, and 5 (2%) had a nonreactive SHC but had one or more reactive tests at the state laboratory. Among the 26 reactive SHCs, 10 (38%) had a reactive EIA (6 had a reactive RPR), and 16 (62%) were not confirmed by EIA or RPR at the state laboratory. For the 6 reactive SHC patients with reactive EIA and reactive RPR, 3 were staged as secondary syphilis, one as primary syphilis, one as early latent syphilis, and one was a previously treated positive with no increase in titer since last testing. Among the 5 specimens that were reactive on other tests but SHC nonreactive, only one was both RPR (1:8 serum dilution) and EIA reactive. It came from a patient with primary syphilis and a history of herpes simplex virus 2, and a reactive RPR (1:2 serum dilution) that was collected 6 days before the SHC test. The sensitivity of SHC was 71.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 41.9%-95.1%) when compared with the Trep-Sure (EIA) reference treponemal test (Table). The specificity of the SHC compared with the reference treponemal test was 91.5% (95% CI = 87.5%-95.5%). The findings in this study are subject to at least one limitation. The sample size was 202; however, results indicate a high proportion of reactive SHC tests were not confirmed by reference treponemal testing (16 of 26, 61.5%). This relatively low positive predictive value suggests that reactive SHC results should be interpreted with caution. Furthermore, 4 of 14 specimens that tested positive on the reference treponemal test tested negative on the SHC, including one from a patient with primary syphilis. Sensitivity and specificity analyses of the SHC using fingerstick specimens at the Florida Department of Health in Escambia County's STD clinic were significantly lower than the over 98% reported by the manufacturer of SHC in a 510(k) submission (3). Further evaluation of the sensitivity and specificity of the SHC in additional health care settings is needed to determine whether SHC might be beneficial in identifying patients who might have syphilis, especially in settings where phlebotomy is unavailable. -- Communicated by: ProMED-mail [According to Trinity Biotech, the manufacturer of Syphilis Health Check (SHC): 'Syphilis Health Check is a qualitative rapid membrane immune-chromatographic assay for the detection of _Treponema pallidum_ (syphilis) antibodies in human whole blood, serum and plasma. The test, which acts as a screening test, will primarily be performed in a CLIA waived setting using finger stick samples of whole blood only, with results being available in as little as 12 minutes. All positive tests should be followed up with further syphilis serological laboratory testing and clinical evaluation before final diagnosis' (). Tests, like SHC, that measure antibody against _T. pallidum_, are called treponemal serological tests. Their results do not indicate the stage of disease and do not differentiate between past and current infection. They may be negative during the 1st few weeks of infection with _T. pallidum_ and do not differentiate syphilis from infections, such as yaws and pinta, caused by closely related treponemal pathogens. Non-treponemal tests such as Rapid Plasma Reagin test (RPR) detect antibodies that are not specifically directed against the _Treponema pallidum_ but against cardiolipin released early in infection. The tests are sensitive, but since they are non-specific, false-positive results can be caused by, for example, IV drug use, pregnancy, Lyme disease, certain types of pneumonia, malaria, tuberculosis, or certain autoimmune disorders including lupus. Because with non-treponemal tests false-positive reactions can occur, confirmation with a treponemal test that is specific for _T. pallidum_ antibodies is recommended. Non-treponemal tests when quantitated are useful in staging the disease and monitoring treatment for syphilis; these tests typically become negative in an adequately treated person after about 3 years, whereas the treponemal tests remain positive for life even after treatment. In some patients, however, non-treponemal antibodies can persist at a low titer for a long period of time, sometimes for the life of the patient. This response is referred to as the 'serofast reaction.' Screening tests, like the SHC, are often used in clinical practice to assess the likelihood that a person has a particular medical condition. Using this test, this study found that if someone has syphilis, there is only 71.4% probability that the screening test will be positive (the sensitivity), with 28.6% having a false-negative reaction. If a someone does not have syphilis, there is a 91.5% probability that the screening test will be negative (the specificity), with 8.5% having a false-positive reaction. If the screening test is positive, the probability that someone actually has the disease (the positive predictive value) is only 38.4% (10 of 26), unlike the 61.5% (16 of 26) that is stated in the report above. - Mod.ML] [See Also: 2015 ---- Syphilis - USA (02): (OH) MSM, rapid point-of-care test 20150125.3117107 Syphilis - USA: rapid point-of-care test 20150112.3085761] .................................................ml/msp/jh/mpp/jh",Syphilis,United States,39.96693,-97.556099,Humans

Virtual reality fans recently received some good news when it was announced that the PlayStation VR outsold every other console on the market in Japan during its 1st week. Virtual reality hasn't quite completely taken the games industry by storm, due in large part to the high price of entry associated with other headsets like the Oculus Rift or HTC Vive, but many industry watchers have said that Sony has a real opportunity with the more affordable PlayStation VR to get a lot more people interested in virtual reality. With the PlayStation VR also starting to pull in positive reviews following its launch 2 weeks ago, things appear to be going really well for Sony and VR fans in general right now. So in other words, this is a really bad time for virtual reality to be associated with a major health scare. But that's exactly what is happening if a screenshot originally posted by YouTuber Drift0r is to be believed. The Daily Dot reports that the screenshot features a conversation between 2 anonymous VR developers who are talking with each other about an ocular herpes outbreak among individuals who have been using VR headsets. It seems that the disease is being passed from gamer to gamer at places like trade shows and demo booths where multiple people share the same headset. 'Ocular herpes is going around VR headsets, ones that are used to share with people,' the 1st developer writes. 'Game studio told us it's going around, have to clean headset regularly.' After some back and forth, another developer confirms the news, noting that ocular herpes is caused by the herpes simplex virus. Ocular herpes causes inflammation and general discomfort, sometimes leading to cold sores but around the eye instead of the mouth, according to the Daily Dot. It's worth noting that this is just one anecdotal claim and it's coming from anonymous developers. We don't even know which specific headset was being referenced in this conversation, but any gamer or member of the games media who has attended conventions like Penny Arcade's PAX or E3 will be the 1st to tell you about the dreaded 'convention flu' that often afflicts multiple attendees in the days following the event. Coming into contact with a game controller that has been touched by hundreds or even thousands of other people has never been good for your health, and now it seems we're seeing an especially gross version of this same problem affect virtual reality headsets. Hopefully, this news will catch the attention of developers who work such events and steps will be taken to ensure a sanitary gaming experience for all involved. Virtual reality still has a lot to prove considering that a lot of gamers still think VR is too expensive, so it's going to be critical for the industry as a whole to come together and make sure stories like this one don't become commonplace. [Byline: Jason Gallagher] -- Communicated by: ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts [ProMED requests information from anyone who may have more knowledge on infection with herpes simplex virus [HSV] associated with VR headsets, as well as information on this particular outbreak of HSV. Caused by the type 1 herpes simplex virus, eye herpes (ocular herpes) is a common, recurrent viral infection affecting the eyes. This type of herpes virus can cause inflammation and scarring of the cornea that sometimes is referred to as a cold sore on the eye. Herpes of the eye can be transmitted through close contact with an infected person whose virus is active. The National Eye Institute (NEI) says an estimated 400 000 Americans have experienced some form of ocular herpes, with close to 50 000 new and recurring cases occurring each year. Forms of Eye Herpes ------------------- Ranging from a simple infection to a condition that can possibly cause blindness, there are several forms of eye herpes: - Herpes keratitis is the most common form of eye herpes and is a viral corneal infection. Ocular herpes in this form generally affects only the top layer, or the epithelium, of the cornea, and usually heals without scarring. - Stromal keratitis occurs when the infection goes deeper into the layers of the cornea. This can lead to scarring, loss of vision and, occasionally, blindness. Stromal keratitis is thought to be caused by a late immune response to the original infection. Although the condition is rare, the NEI reports that stromal keratitis is the leading cause of corneal scarring that subsequently causes blindness in the United States. - Iridocyclitis is a serious form of eye herpes where the iris and surrounding tissues inside the eye become inflamed, causing severe sensitivity to light, blurred vision, pain and red eyes. Iridocyclitis is a type of uveitis that affects the more frontal portions of the inside of the eye. When this infection occurs in the retina or the inside lining of the back of the eye, it is known as herpes retinitis. - ... more What Causes Eye Herpes? ----------------------- Eye herpes is transmitted through contact with another person who is having an outbreak, or through self contact and contamination during an active herpes infection (such as a cold sore of the lip). The herpes simplex virus enters the body through the nose or mouth and travels into the nerves, where it may be inactive. The virus can remain dormant for years and may never wake up. The exact cause of an outbreak is unknown, but stress-related factors such as fever, sunburn, major dental or surgical procedures and trauma are often associated with incidents. Once the initial outbreak occurs, the NEI says untreated eye herpes has about a 40-50 percent chance of returning. There is no specific time frame for ocular herpes to reappear; it could be several weeks or even several years following the original occurrence. Although symptoms usually present themselves in only one eye, the virus possibly could affect the other eye as well. - ... more [Byline: Jessica Hill] Excerpted and edited from - Mod.LK] [It is interesting that the information about this possible outbreak is coming from a social media source. If confirmed, this will be one of the few outbreaks thus far which have been identified through 1st hand reports on social media, further supporting efforts to include social media as information sources for disease outbreak detection. In this case, ocular herpes is not a totally benign disease as highlighted in Mod.LK's comment above, so early detection of such an outbreak is important. We await further information on this report. - Mod.MPP] .................................................sb/lk/je/mpp",Herpes,Worldwide,75,-39.990234,Humans

The child was hospitalized last weekend [22-23 Oct 2016?] and was undergoing treatment. This is the 1st death due to leishmaniasis in the city [Governador Valadares, Minas Gerais state] in 2016. In the same hospital, a 2-year-old was also hospitalized, diagnosed with visceral leishmaniasis. According to the Municipality Office of Communication, this year [2016] there were 15 cases of leishmaniasis reported in humans. In 2015, there were 17 cases and 2 deaths reported due to leishmaniasis. -- Communicated by: ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts [A recent study from Minais Gerais by Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte (1) found that the main vectors were _Lutzomyia longipalpis_ (35.3 percent), _Lutzomyia cortelezzii_ (33.5 percent) and _Lutzomyia whitmani_ (18.3 percent). The seroprevalence in dogs was 5.8 percent and the main Leishmania subspecies were _Leishmania infantum_ and _Leishmania braziliensis_. Reports of visceral leishmaniasis in children are rare. We suppose the 2 children reported here were HIV-negative. A large study from Brazil included 166 pregnant women, of which 25 were Leishmania seropositive. None of the children born to seropositive mothers developed Leishmania during the 18 months post partum follow up period. Two children born to seronegative women developed visceral leishmaniasis at 9 and 12 months of age respectively. Thus, it is most likely that the 2 children reported here acquired the Leishmania infection after birth. References: 1. Menezes JA et al.

Research led by WorldPop, based at the University, examined and mapped the movement of the disease from endemic countries (those where malaria is regularly found in the population) to around 40 countries defined as being malaria-free or non-endemic (such as the UK). Findings, published in the journal The Lancet Infectious Diseases, revealed that countries with the highest average number of imported infections per year over the past decade were France (2169), UK (1898) and USA (1511), followed by Italy (637) and Germany (401). Infection movement was strongly skewed to a small number of 'high-traffic' routes, with malaria cases originating from West Africa accounting for 56 percent (13 947) of all cases detected in non-endemic countries. Andrew Tatem, director of WorldPop and University of Southampton professor of geography, comments, 'This is the 1st worldwide assessment of imported malaria cases in 20 years and mapping this data is hugely valuable in helping us understand how we can mitigate against the effects of the global movements of the disease. 'Imported malaria can be expensive to treat, contribute to drug resistance, sometimes cause secondary local transmission and threaten the long-term goal of eradication. This study forms part of wider efforts to understand patterns of human and malaria parasite movement to help guide elimination strategies.' The research, supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, constructed and analyzed a database of publically available nationally reported statistics on imported malaria covering more than 50 000 individual cases over 10 years. Although most incidents of malaria in non-endemic countries originated in West Africa, the study showed 20 percent were from India (4988), 13 percent from East Africa (3242) and 3 percent from Papua New Guinea (748). While the West Africa to France and UK routes showed the strongest imported malaria link, other high traffic routes included USA/India (149 cases on average per year), Australia/Papua New Guinea (97), UK/Pakistan (69) and USA/Haiti (52). By mapping this complex network of malaria movements across continents the researchers highlighted that a number of factors, beyond geographic ones, influenced the strength of importation levels. For example, historical, economic, language and cultural ties all play a part -- population movements with former colonies had particular influence; such as Nigeria, Ghana and Kenya with the UK, and Mali, Niger and Chad with France. The researchers hope to conduct further studies to examine which factors are the drivers behind the patterns of malaria spread between endemic and non-endemic countries.

The data are well known and not surprising for the travel medicine specialist. Malaria travels with people and the number of imported malaria cases reflects at any given time the travel pattern to a particular country and is well documented here. In travel medicine the traveller categorized as 'visiting friends and relatives (VFR)' is well known. These are people born and raised in malaria endemic areas, now living in non-endemic areas visiting their previous homeland. It is well known that the VFRs are less prone to seek pre-travel advice and less prone to use malaria chemoprophylaxis. The 1st study highlighting this problem was performed by Phillips-Howard (1). Figures of imported malaria fluctuate over time, and considerably higher numbers than reported in the present study are usually found. A study of imported malaria in children reported approximately 1700 yearly cases from 1992-2002 (2), and French studies estimated the annual number of imported malaria cases from 2000-2011 to be between 4800 to 3500 (3,4) and the study confirms recent data from Europe (5). It is generally agreed that cases are underreported. The study confirms that the UK received the majority of imported malaria from Anglophone West Africa, France from Francophone Africa and the Middle East from the Indian subcontinent. References: 1.

The health unit announced the news Friday morning [28 Oct 2016] and said it will continue to monitor the situation. This type of mosquito is thought to be responsible for the majority of human cases of the Zika virus worldwide. The health unit's Dr. Gary Kirk believes it's the 1st in Canada, but said there is 'no risk of the Zika virus.' Public health officials don't think the yellow fever mosquito can survive Canadian winters. Although it is unknown exactly how the larvae arrived in Ontario, one possibility is that the eggs were transported from the U.S. in shipping containers or other cross-border vehicle traffic. The eggs could also have been imported in recycled products, such as tires or other containers. Given that this is a tropical mosquito, the extremely hot temperatures this past summer allowed for the species to exist in Windsor. 'We will continue to ensure that our community stays informed about infectious diseases and the local mosquito surveillance program. It is a key public health service that we provide to Windsor-Essex County residents. 'The discovery of the yellow fever mosquito larvae through enhanced surveillance of the _Aedes albopictus_ mosquito is an important reminder that we should continue to protect ourselves and our families from mosquito bites,' Kirk said. -- Communicated by: ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts [As the public health officials indicated, _Aedes aegypti_ is not cold-adapted and will not survive the winter in Ontario. Killing frosts will occur soon, if they have not happened already, ending the threat that these mosquitoes will become established in the province. Interestingly, the Asian tiger mosquito, _Aedes albopictus_, was found for the 1st time in this same area this month [October 2016], which is why surveillance for this mosquito was being conducted. _Ae. albopictus_ is capable of entering diapause, and may be able to survive the winter there. - Mod.TY A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: .] [See Also: Invasive mosquito - Canada: (ON) 20161013.4558392] .................................................sb/mpp/ty/je/jh/mpp/jh",Pests,"Ontario Province, Canada",51.727001,-86.704201,Humans

WA [West Australia] Health Medical Epidemiologist Dr Gary Dowse said the male passenger was infectious to other passengers after he had been holidaying in Japan. Dr Dowse said the passenger could have also infected other people who came into contact with him at several other Perth locations. The passenger's 1st flight was SQ 633 from Tokyo, arriving in Singapore at around 11pm on 20 Oct [2016]. The man then flew from Singapore to Perth on Singapore Airlines flight SQ 225, arriving in Perth around 5.15am 21 Oct [2016]. Dr Dowse said people who were on these flights, particularly people seated near the ill passenger, were potentially exposed and may be at risk of measles. In addition, people could have been exposed to measles at locations in Perth [listed in URL above]. People have been warned to look out for symptoms including fever, rash, cough, runny nose and sore red eyes. Dr Dowse said public health staff had been contacting people who could have been exposed directly but it was not possible to identify and specifically warn people who were in public places. 'Measles is contagious for about 4 days before and after the development of the rash. Children and adults who have been unwittingly exposed are at risk of developing measles if they are not immune,' Dr Dowse said. 'A person is considered immune to measles if they have previously received 2 doses of a measles vaccine or were born before 1966.' Dr Dowse said individuals who developed a fever with other symptoms -- including cough, runny nose, sore red eyes and a rash -- within 2-3 weeks of potential exposure to someone with measles, should stay at home and consult their doctor. 'Anyone who thinks they are infected should call ahead and mention their possible contact with measles so they can be isolated when they arrive at the GP surgery or Emergency Department, to prevent infecting other patients and staff,' Dr Dowse said. Measles is a serious and highly contagious viral illness spread by tiny droplets released when infected people cough and sneeze. Early symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose and sore eyes, followed by a red blotchy rash about 3 days later. The rash usually starts on the face and spreads to the rest of the body. Measles infections can be especially severe in infants and people with poor immune systems. Naturally occurring measles has been eliminated from WA for about 20 years but occasional cases and small outbreaks occur associated with tourists or WA residents who are infected overseas. People born during or after 1966 should make sure they have had 2 doses of a measles vaccine at some stage in their life, especially before travelling overseas. If they are not sure if they have been vaccinated in the past, it does not hurt to have another dose. Complications following measles can be serious and include ear infections and pneumonia in about 10 per cent of cases. Around 40 per cent of cases require hospitalisation and about one person in every 1000 will develop encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain. [Byline: Regina Titelius] -- Communicated by: ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts [In Japan, a combined measles-rubella vaccine started being administered twice per person in 2006. Japan's previous practice of one-time vaccination failed to confer immunity in many cases, leading to a widespread measles outbreak among people between 10 and 30 in 2007 that forced the closure of the entire university system. 'Measles infections usually peak between spring and summer,' said Keiko Taya, chief of the institute [National Institute of Infectious Diseases]'s Infectious Disease Surveillance Center. ... One in 1000 measles sufferers is said to die and adults tend to develop serious symptoms. Pregnant women with measles are at risk of miscarriage or premature birth. Japan is internationally known as a 'measles exporter.' The combined MMR vaccine touted in 1989 for measles, mumps and rubella gave rise to reports of severe side effects -- including some deaths. This caused it to be shunned by families, creating an entire generation of uninoculated kids in the '90s who are now turning into adults. (Excerpted and edited from ) Japan is facing the same problem as many other developed countries, that is how to educate people that measles is not always a mild disease and the MMR vaccine will prevent measles, is safe and efficacious.

According to the county disease surveillance officer, Leroy Maximore, the outbreak is in the Firestone Rubber Plantation area and the health team is doing all it can to contain the outbreak. He said in the 1st 3 weeks of October [2016], the Firestone Health District has reported 15 cases of measles, of which 4 were confirmed positive and 6 negative. The rest of the results are yet to be known, pending the completion of the laboratory tests. Maximore described the current situation as an epidemic in the county and said the county was treating it as a health emergency. He said a team of health volunteers is currently carrying out active surveillance and those affected are undergoing medical treatment. In March of this year [2016], there was 1 death and 26 confirmed cases of measles. In April 2015, a total of 77 cases were recorded along with 6 deaths. Maximore said the Firestone Health District is the epicenter of the current outbreak; there are no suspected or confirmed measles cases in the remaining 3 health districts. He blamed the outbreak on the natural rubber company. 'The problem we have had with the Firestone health authorities is their failure to carry out 24/7 routine vaccinations,' Maximore said. 'Instead, they only do it once a week and this has made people vulnerable to contagious diseases.' Meanwhile, the health surveillance officer is calling on partners to help provide the necessary support to enable the county's health team to prevent future spread of the disease.

The risk of acquiring the always fatal neurological disorder, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), was believed to be about 1-in-1700, based on an earlier German study of children under 5 years of age infected with measles. The new research, looking at children who got measles during a large California [USA] outbreak around 1990, found the rate of SSPE to be 1-in-1387 for those infected before the age of 5. It rose to about 1-in-600 for babies infected before their 1st birthday. 'That is a very frightening surprise,' said Dr. James Cherry, a research professor in pediatric infectious diseases at UCLA, who was part of the study team. 'The answer is good public health. You need to vaccinate everybody and create herd immunity so that you protect those most vulnerable to measles and those at greatest risk of SSPE,' Cherry said in a telephone interview. Herd immunity would protect infants too young to get the measles vaccine and people with compromised immune systems ineligible for vaccination. The average age of SSPE diagnosis was 12, but the range was from 3-35, researchers said. The findings were presented at an infectious disease meeting in New Orleans known as ID Week [ID Week meeting 26-30 Oct 2016 New Orleans, Louisiana, USA; Session: Vaccines, Vaccine Preventable Disease, and their Impact ]. The presentation included an account of a mother whose 5-month-old got measles after a trip to Disneyland during an outbreak last year [2015]. 'She says 'Now I have to worry about this for the next 10 years.' It's kind of sobering,' Cherry said. Merck & Co and GlaxoSmithKline are among the main manufacturers of measles vaccines. Researchers hope the data will raise alarms with parents who refuse vaccines for their children, despite science confirming their safety and benefits. They also cautioned parents about traveling with unprotected children to countries where measles is endemic. 'No child should go to Europe or the Philippines who hasn't had 2 doses of measles vaccine. It's just too risky,' Cherry said. Dr. Peter Hotez, an infectious disease expert from Houston [Texas, USA] who was not involved in the study, said a growing anti-vaccination movement in Texas could lead to measles outbreaks there. 'Once vaccination coverage rates start going below 90 to 95 percent, because it's so highly infectious, that's when you start to see measles. It's going to come back and it's not a benign disease,' Hotez said. Even without SSPE, measles can kill or cause encephalitis. 'We have to vaccinate our kids or we are going to suffer the consequences,' Hotez warned.

The public generally considers measles to be a benign disease of children. But it can be very serious, even life threatening. This paper, presented at ID Week 2016, makes this clear. The report, entitled 'Subacute Sclerosing Panencephalitis: the Devastating Measles Complication is More Common than We Think' by K Wendorf et al., concludes: 'SSPE cases in California occurred at much higher rate than previously published among unvaccinated children who were infected with measles in infancy. Protection of infants younger than 12-15 months of age, when measles vaccine is routinely administered, requires avoidance of travel to endemic areas, or early vaccination prior to travel. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of SSPE in patients with compatible symptoms, even in older patients with no specific history of measles infection. SSPE demonstrates the high human cost of 'natural' measles immunity.' Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a progressive neurological disorder of children and young adults that affects the central nervous system (CNS). It is a slow, but persistent, viral infection caused by defective measles virus. SSPE has been reported from all parts of the world, but it is considered a rare disease in developed countries, with fewer than 10 cases per year reported in the United States [but the report above suggests this estimate is low]. The incidence of SSPE declined by at least 90 percent in countries that have practiced widespread immunization with measles vaccine. The incidence of SSPE is still high in developing countries such as India and Eastern Europe. There is a higher incidence among males than females (male/female: 3/1). Most youngsters with SSPE have a history of measles infection at an early age, usually younger than 2 years, followed by a latent period of 6 to 8 years before neurological symptoms begin. Despite the long interval between the measles infection and the onset of SSPE, researchers think that the infection of the brain occurs soon after the primary bout with measles and progresses slowly. Why it persists and progresses still isn't clear. The initial symptoms of SSPE are subtle and include mild mental deterioration (such as memory loss) and changes in behavior (such as irritability) followed by disturbances in motor function, including uncontrollable involuntary jerking movements of the head, trunk or limbs called myoclonic jerks. Seizures may also occur. Some people may become blind. In advanced stages of the disease, individuals may lose the ability to walk, as their muscles stiffen or spasm. There is progressive deterioration to a comatose state, and then to a persistent vegetative state. Death is usually the result of fever, heart failure, or the brain's inability to continue controlling the autonomic nervous system. Currently, there is no cure for SSPE. Clinical trials of antiviral (isoprinosine and ribavirin) and immunomodulatory (interferon alpha) drugs have suggested that these types of therapies given alone or in combination halt the progression of the disease and can prolong life, but their long-term effects on individuals, and eventual outcome, are unknown. Good nursing care is the most important aspect of treatment for SSPE, along with anticonvulsant and antispasmodic drugs when needed. Most individuals with SSPE will die within 1 to 3 years of diagnosis. In a small percentage of people, the disease will progress rapidly, leading to death over a short course within 3 months of diagnosis. Another small group will have a chronic, slowly progressive form, some with relapses and remissions. A very small number (approximately 5 percent) may experience spontaneous long term improvement and regain lost function. Prevention, in the form of measles vaccination, is the only real 'cure' for SSPE.

Moreover, the Ministry also says that the infection has killed 6 people this year. Two deaths have been reported in the last few days in Arad county. A 27-year-old woman, who was apparently HIV positive, died at the hospital. A 1-year-old baby girl also died in a village near Arad. Apparently, she had a bad medical condition due to malnutrition, as she only weighed 6 kilograms. Measles cases were reported in 30 counties, with most of them being registered in Arad county, namely 223. Mures county comes next with 190 cases registered by 28 Oct [2016], followed by Bistrita with 128 cases, Timis - 91, Cluj - 90, Caras-Severin - 39, Brasov - 37, Suceava - 34, Hunedoara - 18, Dolj - 15, Bihor - 13, and Salaj - 11. Only 3 cases were registered in Bucharest. 'Most cases are outbreaks in communities with low vaccine coverage,' reads the Ministry's statement. Other counties that have reported cases of measles were Harghita, Alba, Iasi, Olt, Sibiu, Bacau, Constanta, Dambovita, Neamt, Braila, Giurgiu, Mehedinti, Vaslui, Botosani, Buzau, Prahova, and Valcea. The Health Ministry advises parents to respect the vaccination schedule, and to address family doctors for immunization. The high number of cases could be the result of the anti-vaccination campaign that has drawn a lot of supporters among Romanian parents in recent years. Those who oppose vaccination against measles, mumps, and rubella claim that the vaccine causes autism. Measles is a highly contagious respiratory infection caused by a virus. It causes a total-body skin rash and flu-like symptoms, including fever, cough, and runny nose. According to information posted on the World Health Organization's website, the virus is highly contagious, spreading by coughing and sneezing, close personal contact or direct contact with infected nasal or throat secretions. Unvaccinated young children are at highest risk of measles and its complications, including death.

WA [West Australia] Health Medical Epidemiologist Dr Gary Dowse said the male passenger was infectious to other passengers after he had been holidaying in Japan. Dr Dowse said the passenger could have also infected other people who came into contact with him at several other Perth locations. The passenger's 1st flight was SQ 633 from Tokyo, arriving in Singapore at around 11pm on 20 Oct [2016]. The man then flew from Singapore to Perth on Singapore Airlines flight SQ 225, arriving in Perth around 5.15am 21 Oct [2016]. Dr Dowse said people who were on these flights, particularly people seated near the ill passenger, were potentially exposed and may be at risk of measles. In addition, people could have been exposed to measles at locations in Perth [listed in URL above]. People have been warned to look out for symptoms including fever, rash, cough, runny nose and sore red eyes. Dr Dowse said public health staff had been contacting people who could have been exposed directly but it was not possible to identify and specifically warn people who were in public places. 'Measles is contagious for about 4 days before and after the development of the rash. Children and adults who have been unwittingly exposed are at risk of developing measles if they are not immune,' Dr Dowse said. 'A person is considered immune to measles if they have previously received 2 doses of a measles vaccine or were born before 1966.' Dr Dowse said individuals who developed a fever with other symptoms -- including cough, runny nose, sore red eyes and a rash -- within 2-3 weeks of potential exposure to someone with measles, should stay at home and consult their doctor. 'Anyone who thinks they are infected should call ahead and mention their possible contact with measles so they can be isolated when they arrive at the GP surgery or Emergency Department, to prevent infecting other patients and staff,' Dr Dowse said. Measles is a serious and highly contagious viral illness spread by tiny droplets released when infected people cough and sneeze. Early symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose and sore eyes, followed by a red blotchy rash about 3 days later. The rash usually starts on the face and spreads to the rest of the body. Measles infections can be especially severe in infants and people with poor immune systems. Naturally occurring measles has been eliminated from WA for about 20 years but occasional cases and small outbreaks occur associated with tourists or WA residents who are infected overseas. People born during or after 1966 should make sure they have had 2 doses of a measles vaccine at some stage in their life, especially before travelling overseas. If they are not sure if they have been vaccinated in the past, it does not hurt to have another dose. Complications following measles can be serious and include ear infections and pneumonia in about 10 per cent of cases. Around 40 per cent of cases require hospitalisation and about one person in every 1000 will develop encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain. [Byline: Regina Titelius] -- Communicated by: ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts [In Japan, a combined measles-rubella vaccine started being administered twice per person in 2006. Japan's previous practice of one-time vaccination failed to confer immunity in many cases, leading to a widespread measles outbreak among people between 10 and 30 in 2007 that forced the closure of the entire university system. 'Measles infections usually peak between spring and summer,' said Keiko Taya, chief of the institute [National Institute of Infectious Diseases]'s Infectious Disease Surveillance Center. ... One in 1000 measles sufferers is said to die and adults tend to develop serious symptoms. Pregnant women with measles are at risk of miscarriage or premature birth. Japan is internationally known as a 'measles exporter.' The combined MMR vaccine touted in 1989 for measles, mumps and rubella gave rise to reports of severe side effects -- including some deaths. This caused it to be shunned by families, creating an entire generation of uninoculated kids in the '90s who are now turning into adults. (Excerpted and edited from ) Japan is facing the same problem as many other developed countries, that is how to educate people that measles is not always a mild disease and the MMR vaccine will prevent measles, is safe and efficacious.

According to the county disease surveillance officer, Leroy Maximore, the outbreak is in the Firestone Rubber Plantation area and the health team is doing all it can to contain the outbreak. He said in the 1st 3 weeks of October [2016], the Firestone Health District has reported 15 cases of measles, of which 4 were confirmed positive and 6 negative. The rest of the results are yet to be known, pending the completion of the laboratory tests. Maximore described the current situation as an epidemic in the county and said the county was treating it as a health emergency. He said a team of health volunteers is currently carrying out active surveillance and those affected are undergoing medical treatment. In March of this year [2016], there was 1 death and 26 confirmed cases of measles. In April 2015, a total of 77 cases were recorded along with 6 deaths. Maximore said the Firestone Health District is the epicenter of the current outbreak; there are no suspected or confirmed measles cases in the remaining 3 health districts. He blamed the outbreak on the natural rubber company. 'The problem we have had with the Firestone health authorities is their failure to carry out 24/7 routine vaccinations,' Maximore said. 'Instead, they only do it once a week and this has made people vulnerable to contagious diseases.' Meanwhile, the health surveillance officer is calling on partners to help provide the necessary support to enable the county's health team to prevent future spread of the disease. He said if nothing is done in the next few days to promptly handle the outbreak, there could be an increase in the number of cases in the area. Maximore said between January and October of this year [2016], the county has reported 253 cases of measles in the 4 health districts, with a fatality rate of 0.79 percent.

WA [West Australia] Health Medical Epidemiologist Dr Gary Dowse said the male passenger was infectious to other passengers after he had been holidaying in Japan. Dr Dowse said the passenger could have also infected other people who came into contact with him at several other Perth locations. The passenger's 1st flight was SQ 633 from Tokyo, arriving in Singapore at around 11pm on 20 Oct [2016]. The man then flew from Singapore to Perth on Singapore Airlines flight SQ 225, arriving in Perth around 5.15am 21 Oct [2016]. Dr Dowse said people who were on these flights, particularly people seated near the ill passenger, were potentially exposed and may be at risk of measles. In addition, people could have been exposed to measles at locations in Perth [listed in URL above]. People have been warned to look out for symptoms including fever, rash, cough, runny nose and sore red eyes. Dr Dowse said public health staff had been contacting people who could have been exposed directly but it was not possible to identify and specifically warn people who were in public places. 'Measles is contagious for about 4 days before and after the development of the rash. Children and adults who have been unwittingly exposed are at risk of developing measles if they are not immune,' Dr Dowse said. 'A person is considered immune to measles if they have previously received 2 doses of a measles vaccine or were born before 1966.' Dr Dowse said individuals who developed a fever with other symptoms -- including cough, runny nose, sore red eyes and a rash -- within 2-3 weeks of potential exposure to someone with measles, should stay at home and consult their doctor. 'Anyone who thinks they are infected should call ahead and mention their possible contact with measles so they can be isolated when they arrive at the GP surgery or Emergency Department, to prevent infecting other patients and staff,' Dr Dowse said. Measles is a serious and highly contagious viral illness spread by tiny droplets released when infected people cough and sneeze. Early symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose and sore eyes, followed by a red blotchy rash about 3 days later. The rash usually starts on the face and spreads to the rest of the body. Measles infections can be especially severe in infants and people with poor immune systems. Naturally occurring measles has been eliminated from WA for about 20 years but occasional cases and small outbreaks occur associated with tourists or WA residents who are infected overseas. People born during or after 1966 should make sure they have had 2 doses of a measles vaccine at some stage in their life, especially before travelling overseas. If they are not sure if they have been vaccinated in the past, it does not hurt to have another dose. Complications following measles can be serious and include ear infections and pneumonia in about 10 per cent of cases. Around 40 per cent of cases require hospitalisation and about one person in every 1000 will develop encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain. [Byline: Regina Titelius] -- Communicated by: ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts [In Japan, a combined measles-rubella vaccine started being administered twice per person in 2006. Japan's previous practice of one-time vaccination failed to confer immunity in many cases, leading to a widespread measles outbreak among people between 10 and 30 in 2007 that forced the closure of the entire university system. 'Measles infections usually peak between spring and summer,' said Keiko Taya, chief of the institute [National Institute of Infectious Diseases]'s Infectious Disease Surveillance Center. ... One in 1000 measles sufferers is said to die and adults tend to develop serious symptoms. Pregnant women with measles are at risk of miscarriage or premature birth. Japan is internationally known as a 'measles exporter.' The combined MMR vaccine touted in 1989 for measles, mumps and rubella gave rise to reports of severe side effects -- including some deaths. This caused it to be shunned by families, creating an entire generation of uninoculated kids in the '90s who are now turning into adults. (Excerpted and edited from ) Japan is facing the same problem as many other developed countries, that is how to educate people that measles is not always a mild disease and the MMR vaccine will prevent measles, is safe and efficacious.

According to the county disease surveillance officer, Leroy Maximore, the outbreak is in the Firestone Rubber Plantation area and the health team is doing all it can to contain the outbreak. He said in the 1st 3 weeks of October [2016], the Firestone Health District has reported 15 cases of measles, of which 4 were confirmed positive and 6 negative. The rest of the results are yet to be known, pending the completion of the laboratory tests. Maximore described the current situation as an epidemic in the county and said the county was treating it as a health emergency. He said a team of health volunteers is currently carrying out active surveillance and those affected are undergoing medical treatment. In March of this year [2016], there was 1 death and 26 confirmed cases of measles. In April 2015, a total of 77 cases were recorded along with 6 deaths. Maximore said the Firestone Health District is the epicenter of the current outbreak; there are no suspected or confirmed measles cases in the remaining 3 health districts. He blamed the outbreak on the natural rubber company. 'The problem we have had with the Firestone health authorities is their failure to carry out 24/7 routine vaccinations,' Maximore said. 'Instead, they only do it once a week and this has made people vulnerable to contagious diseases.' Meanwhile, the health surveillance officer is calling on partners to help provide the necessary support to enable the county's health team to prevent future spread of the disease. He said if nothing is done in the next few days to promptly handle the outbreak, there could be an increase in the number of cases in the area. Maximore said between January and October of this year [2016], the county has reported 253 cases of measles in the 4 health districts, with a fatality rate of 0.79 percent.

The risk of acquiring the always fatal neurological disorder, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), was believed to be about 1-in-1700, based on an earlier German study of children under 5 years of age infected with measles. The new research, looking at children who got measles during a large California [USA] outbreak around 1990, found the rate of SSPE to be 1-in-1387 for those infected before the age of 5. It rose to about 1-in-600 for babies infected before their 1st birthday. 'That is a very frightening surprise,' said Dr. James Cherry, a research professor in pediatric infectious diseases at UCLA, who was part of the study team. 'The answer is good public health. You need to vaccinate everybody and create herd immunity so that you protect those most vulnerable to measles and those at greatest risk of SSPE,' Cherry said in a telephone interview. Herd immunity would protect infants too young to get the measles vaccine and people with compromised immune systems ineligible for vaccination. The average age of SSPE diagnosis was 12, but the range was from 3-35, researchers said. The findings were presented at an infectious disease meeting in New Orleans known as ID Week [ID Week meeting 26-30 Oct 2016 New Orleans, Louisiana, USA; Session: Vaccines, Vaccine Preventable Disease, and their Impact ]. The presentation included an account of a mother whose 5-month-old got measles after a trip to Disneyland during an outbreak last year [2015]. 'She says 'Now I have to worry about this for the next 10 years.' It's kind of sobering,' Cherry said. Merck & Co and GlaxoSmithKline are among the main manufacturers of measles vaccines. Researchers hope the data will raise alarms with parents who refuse vaccines for their children, despite science confirming their safety and benefits. They also cautioned parents about traveling with unprotected children to countries where measles is endemic. 'No child should go to Europe or the Philippines who hasn't had 2 doses of measles vaccine. It's just too risky,' Cherry said. Dr. Peter Hotez, an infectious disease expert from Houston [Texas, USA] who was not involved in the study, said a growing anti-vaccination movement in Texas could lead to measles outbreaks there. 'Once vaccination coverage rates start going below 90 to 95 percent, because it's so highly infectious, that's when you start to see measles. It's going to come back and it's not a benign disease,' Hotez said. Even without SSPE, measles can kill or cause encephalitis. 'We have to vaccinate our kids or we are going to suffer the consequences,' Hotez warned. [Byline: Bill Berkrot] -- Communicated by: ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts [This is an important study by the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) that adds even more fuel to the fire stressing the public health and life saving importance of the MMR vaccine [see ProMED-mail post Vaccination: cost of not vaccinating 20161026.4586152]. The public generally considers measles to be a benign disease of children. But it can be very serious, even life threatening. This paper, presented at ID Week 2016, makes this clear. The report, entitled 'Subacute Sclerosing Panencephalitis: the Devastating Measles Complication is More Common than We Think' by K Wendorf et al., concludes: 'SSPE cases in California occurred at much higher rate than previously published among unvaccinated children who were infected with measles in infancy. Protection of infants younger than 12-15 months of age, when measles vaccine is routinely administered, requires avoidance of travel to endemic areas, or early vaccination prior to travel. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of SSPE in patients with compatible symptoms, even in older patients with no specific history of measles infection. SSPE demonstrates the high human cost of 'natural' measles immunity.' Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a progressive neurological disorder of children and young adults that affects the central nervous system (CNS). It is a slow, but persistent, viral infection caused by defective measles virus. SSPE has been reported from all parts of the world, but it is considered a rare disease in developed countries, with fewer than 10 cases per year reported in the United States [but the report above suggests this estimate is low]. The incidence of SSPE declined by at least 90 percent in countries that have practiced widespread immunization with measles vaccine. The incidence of SSPE is still high in developing countries such as India and Eastern Europe. There is a higher incidence among males than females (male/female: 3/1). Most youngsters with SSPE have a history of measles infection at an early age, usually younger than 2 years, followed by a latent period of 6 to 8 years before neurological symptoms begin. Despite the long interval between the measles infection and the onset of SSPE, researchers think that the infection of the brain occurs soon after the primary bout with measles and progresses slowly. Why it persists and progresses still isn't clear. The initial symptoms of SSPE are subtle and include mild mental deterioration (such as memory loss) and changes in behavior (such as irritability) followed by disturbances in motor function, including uncontrollable involuntary jerking movements of the head, trunk or limbs called myoclonic jerks. Seizures may also occur. Some people may become blind. In advanced stages of the disease, individuals may lose the ability to walk, as their muscles stiffen or spasm. There is progressive deterioration to a comatose state, and then to a persistent vegetative state. Death is usually the result of fever, heart failure, or the brain's inability to continue controlling the autonomic nervous system. Currently, there is no cure for SSPE. Clinical trials of antiviral (isoprinosine and ribavirin) and immunomodulatory (interferon alpha) drugs have suggested that these types of therapies given alone or in combination halt the progression of the disease and can prolong life, but their long-term effects on individuals, and eventual outcome, are unknown. Good nursing care is the most important aspect of treatment for SSPE, along with anticonvulsant and antispasmodic drugs when needed. Most individuals with SSPE will die within 1 to 3 years of diagnosis. In a small percentage of people, the disease will progress rapidly, leading to death over a short course within 3 months of diagnosis. Another small group will have a chronic, slowly progressive form, some with relapses and remissions. A very small number (approximately 5 percent) may experience spontaneous long term improvement and regain lost function. Prevention, in the form of measles vaccination, is the only real 'cure' for SSPE.

Moreover, the Ministry also says that the infection has killed 6 people this year. Two deaths have been reported in the last few days in Arad county. A 27-year-old woman, who was apparently HIV positive, died at the hospital. A 1-year-old baby girl also died in a village near Arad. Apparently, she had a bad medical condition due to malnutrition, as she only weighed 6 kilograms. Measles cases were reported in 30 counties, with most of them being registered in Arad county, namely 223. Mures county comes next with 190 cases registered by 28 Oct [2016], followed by Bistrita with 128 cases, Timis - 91, Cluj - 90, Caras-Severin - 39, Brasov - 37, Suceava - 34, Hunedoara - 18, Dolj - 15, Bihor - 13, and Salaj - 11. Only 3 cases were registered in Bucharest. 'Most cases are outbreaks in communities with low vaccine coverage,' reads the Ministry's statement. Other counties that have reported cases of measles were Harghita, Alba, Iasi, Olt, Sibiu, Bacau, Constanta, Dambovita, Neamt, Braila, Giurgiu, Mehedinti, Vaslui, Botosani, Buzau, Prahova, and Valcea. The Health Ministry advises parents to respect the vaccination schedule, and to address family doctors for immunization. The high number of cases could be the result of the anti-vaccination campaign that has drawn a lot of supporters among Romanian parents in recent years.

Dr Dowse said the passenger could have also infected other people who came into contact with him at several other Perth locations. The passenger's 1st flight was SQ 633 from Tokyo, arriving in Singapore at around 11pm on 20 Oct [2016]. The man then flew from Singapore to Perth on Singapore Airlines flight SQ 225, arriving in Perth around 5.15am 21 Oct [2016]. Dr Dowse said people who were on these flights, particularly people seated near the ill passenger, were potentially exposed and may be at risk of measles. In addition, people could have been exposed to measles at locations in Perth [listed in URL above]. People have been warned to look out for symptoms including fever, rash, cough, runny nose and sore red eyes. Dr Dowse said public health staff had been contacting people who could have been exposed directly but it was not possible to identify and specifically warn people who were in public places. 'Measles is contagious for about 4 days before and after the development of the rash. Children and adults who have been unwittingly exposed are at risk of developing measles if they are not immune,' Dr Dowse said. 'A person is considered immune to measles if they have previously received 2 doses of a measles vaccine or were born before 1966.' Dr Dowse said individuals who developed a fever with other symptoms -- including cough, runny nose, sore red eyes and a rash -- within 2-3 weeks of potential exposure to someone with measles, should stay at home and consult their doctor. 'Anyone who thinks they are infected should call ahead and mention their possible contact with measles so they can be isolated when they arrive at the GP surgery or Emergency Department, to prevent infecting other patients and staff,' Dr Dowse said. Measles is a serious and highly contagious viral illness spread by tiny droplets released when infected people cough and sneeze. Early symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose and sore eyes, followed by a red blotchy rash about 3 days later. The rash usually starts on the face and spreads to the rest of the body. Measles infections can be especially severe in infants and people with poor immune systems. Naturally occurring measles has been eliminated from WA for about 20 years but occasional cases and small outbreaks occur associated with tourists or WA residents who are infected overseas. People born during or after 1966 should make sure they have had 2 doses of a measles vaccine at some stage in their life, especially before travelling overseas. If they are not sure if they have been vaccinated in the past, it does not hurt to have another dose. Complications following measles can be serious and include ear infections and pneumonia in about 10 per cent of cases. Around 40 per cent of cases require hospitalisation and about one person in every 1000 will develop encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain. [Byline: Regina Titelius] -- Communicated by: ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts [In Japan, a combined measles-rubella vaccine started being administered twice per person in 2006. Japan's previous practice of one-time vaccination failed to confer immunity in many cases, leading to a widespread measles outbreak among people between 10 and 30 in 2007 that forced the closure of the entire university system. 'Measles infections usually peak between spring and summer,' said Keiko Taya, chief of the institute [National Institute of Infectious Diseases]'s Infectious Disease Surveillance Center. ... One in 1000 measles sufferers is said to die and adults tend to develop serious symptoms. Pregnant women with measles are at risk of miscarriage or premature birth. Japan is internationally known as a 'measles exporter.' The combined MMR vaccine touted in 1989 for measles, mumps and rubella gave rise to reports of severe side effects -- including some deaths. This caused it to be shunned by families, creating an entire generation of uninoculated kids in the '90s who are now turning into adults. (Excerpted and edited from ) Japan is facing the same problem as many other developed countries, that is how to educate people that measles is not always a mild disease and the MMR vaccine will prevent measles, is safe and efficacious.

According to the county disease surveillance officer, Leroy Maximore, the outbreak is in the Firestone Rubber Plantation area and the health team is doing all it can to contain the outbreak. He said in the 1st 3 weeks of October [2016], the Firestone Health District has reported 15 cases of measles, of which 4 were confirmed positive and 6 negative. The rest of the results are yet to be known, pending the completion of the laboratory tests. Maximore described the current situation as an epidemic in the county and said the county was treating it as a health emergency. He said a team of health volunteers is currently carrying out active surveillance and those affected are undergoing medical treatment. In March of this year [2016], there was 1 death and 26 confirmed cases of measles. In April 2015, a total of 77 cases were recorded along with 6 deaths. Maximore said the Firestone Health District is the epicenter of the current outbreak; there are no suspected or confirmed measles cases in the remaining 3 health districts. He blamed the outbreak on the natural rubber company. 'The problem we have had with the Firestone health authorities is their failure to carry out 24/7 routine vaccinations,' Maximore said. 'Instead, they only do it once a week and this has made people vulnerable to contagious diseases.' Meanwhile, the health surveillance officer is calling on partners to help provide the necessary support to enable the county's health team to prevent future spread of the disease. He said if nothing is done in the next few days to promptly handle the outbreak, there could be an increase in the number of cases in the area. Maximore said between January and October of this year [2016], the county has reported 253 cases of measles in the 4 health districts, with a fatality rate of 0.79 percent.

The risk of acquiring the always fatal neurological disorder, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), was believed to be about 1-in-1700, based on an earlier German study of children under 5 years of age infected with measles. The new research, looking at children who got measles during a large California [USA] outbreak around 1990, found the rate of SSPE to be 1-in-1387 for those infected before the age of 5. It rose to about 1-in-600 for babies infected before their 1st birthday. 'That is a very frightening surprise,' said Dr. James Cherry, a research professor in pediatric infectious diseases at UCLA, who was part of the study team. 'The answer is good public health. You need to vaccinate everybody and create herd immunity so that you protect those most vulnerable to measles and those at greatest risk of SSPE,' Cherry said in a telephone interview. Herd immunity would protect infants too young to get the measles vaccine and people with compromised immune systems ineligible for vaccination. The average age of SSPE diagnosis was 12, but the range was from 3-35, researchers said. The findings were presented at an infectious disease meeting in New Orleans known as ID Week [ID Week meeting 26-30 Oct 2016 New Orleans, Louisiana, USA; Session: Vaccines, Vaccine Preventable Disease, and their Impact ]. The presentation included an account of a mother whose 5-month-old got measles after a trip to Disneyland during an outbreak last year [2015]. 'She says 'Now I have to worry about this for the next 10 years.' It's kind of sobering,' Cherry said. Merck & Co and GlaxoSmithKline are among the main manufacturers of measles vaccines. Researchers hope the data will raise alarms with parents who refuse vaccines for their children, despite science confirming their safety and benefits. They also cautioned parents about traveling with unprotected children to countries where measles is endemic. 'No child should go to Europe or the Philippines who hasn't had 2 doses of measles vaccine. It's just too risky,' Cherry said. Dr. Peter Hotez, an infectious disease expert from Houston [Texas, USA] who was not involved in the study, said a growing anti-vaccination movement in Texas could lead to measles outbreaks there. 'Once vaccination coverage rates start going below 90 to 95 percent, because it's so highly infectious, that's when you start to see measles. It's going to come back and it's not a benign disease,' Hotez said. Even without SSPE, measles can kill or cause encephalitis. 'We have to vaccinate our kids or we are going to suffer the consequences,' Hotez warned. [Byline: Bill Berkrot] -- Communicated by: ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts [This is an important study by the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) that adds even more fuel to the fire stressing the public health and life saving importance of the MMR vaccine [see ProMED-mail post Vaccination: cost of not vaccinating 20161026.4586152]. The public generally considers measles to be a benign disease of children. But it can be very serious, even life threatening. This paper, presented at ID Week 2016, makes this clear. The report, entitled 'Subacute Sclerosing Panencephalitis: the Devastating Measles Complication is More Common than We Think' by K Wendorf et al., concludes: 'SSPE cases in California occurred at much higher rate than previously published among unvaccinated children who were infected with measles in infancy. Protection of infants younger than 12-15 months of age, when measles vaccine is routinely administered, requires avoidance of travel to endemic areas, or early vaccination prior to travel. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of SSPE in patients with compatible symptoms, even in older patients with no specific history of measles infection. SSPE demonstrates the high human cost of 'natural' measles immunity.' Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a progressive neurological disorder of children and young adults that affects the central nervous system (CNS). It is a slow, but persistent, viral infection caused by defective measles virus. SSPE has been reported from all parts of the world, but it is considered a rare disease in developed countries, with fewer than 10 cases per year reported in the United States [but the report above suggests this estimate is low]. The incidence of SSPE declined by at least 90 percent in countries that have practiced widespread immunization with measles vaccine. The incidence of SSPE is still high in developing countries such as India and Eastern Europe. There is a higher incidence among males than females (male/female: 3/1). Most youngsters with SSPE have a history of measles infection at an early age, usually younger than 2 years, followed by a latent period of 6 to 8 years before neurological symptoms begin. Despite the long interval between the measles infection and the onset of SSPE, researchers think that the infection of the brain occurs soon after the primary bout with measles and progresses slowly. Why it persists and progresses still isn't clear. The initial symptoms of SSPE are subtle and include mild mental deterioration (such as memory loss) and changes in behavior (such as irritability) followed by disturbances in motor function, including uncontrollable involuntary jerking movements of the head, trunk or limbs called myoclonic jerks. Seizures may also occur. Some people may become blind. In advanced stages of the disease, individuals may lose the ability to walk, as their muscles stiffen or spasm. There is progressive deterioration to a comatose state, and then to a persistent vegetative state. Death is usually the result of fever, heart failure, or the brain's inability to continue controlling the autonomic nervous system. Currently, there is no cure for SSPE. Clinical trials of antiviral (isoprinosine and ribavirin) and immunomodulatory (interferon alpha) drugs have suggested that these types of therapies given alone or in combination halt the progression of the disease and can prolong life, but their long-term effects on individuals, and eventual outcome, are unknown. Good nursing care is the most important aspect of treatment for SSPE, along with anticonvulsant and antispasmodic drugs when needed. Most individuals with SSPE will die within 1 to 3 years of diagnosis. In a small percentage of people, the disease will progress rapidly, leading to death over a short course within 3 months of diagnosis. Another small group will have a chronic, slowly progressive form, some with relapses and remissions. A very small number (approximately 5 percent) may experience spontaneous long term improvement and regain lost function. Prevention, in the form of measles vaccination, is the only real 'cure' for SSPE.

Moreover, the Ministry also says that the infection has killed 6 people this year. Two deaths have been reported in the last few days in Arad county. A 27-year-old woman, who was apparently HIV positive, died at the hospital. A 1-year-old baby girl also died in a village near Arad. Apparently, she had a bad medical condition due to malnutrition, as she only weighed 6 kilograms. Measles cases were reported in 30 counties, with most of them being registered in Arad county, namely 223. Mures county comes next with 190 cases registered by 28 Oct [2016], followed by Bistrita with 128 cases, Timis - 91, Cluj - 90, Caras-Severin - 39, Brasov - 37, Suceava - 34, Hunedoara - 18, Dolj - 15, Bihor - 13, and Salaj - 11. Only 3 cases were registered in Bucharest. 'Most cases are outbreaks in communities with low vaccine coverage,' reads the Ministry's statement. Other counties that have reported cases of measles were Harghita, Alba, Iasi, Olt, Sibiu, Bacau, Constanta, Dambovita, Neamt, Braila, Giurgiu, Mehedinti, Vaslui, Botosani, Buzau, Prahova, and Valcea. The Health Ministry advises parents to respect the vaccination schedule, and to address family doctors for immunization. The high number of cases could be the result of the anti-vaccination campaign that has drawn a lot of supporters among Romanian parents in recent years. Those who oppose vaccination against measles, mumps, and rubella claim that the vaccine causes autism. Measles is a highly contagious respiratory infection caused by a virus. It causes a total-body skin rash and flu-like symptoms, including fever, cough, and runny nose. According to information posted on the World Health Organization's website, the virus is highly contagious, spreading by coughing and sneezing, close personal contact or direct contact with infected nasal or throat secretions. Unvaccinated young children are at highest risk of measles and its complications, including death.

Democratic Republic of the Congo epidemiological update (as of 26 Oct [2016]): - The last confirmed non-sylvatic case had symptom onset on 12 Jul [2016]. - A new confirmed, sylvatic case was reported from Bominenge Health Zone in Sud Ubangui province. - 14 probable cases remain under investigation. - The reactive campaign in Mushenge Health Zone in Kasai province, which began on 20 Oct [2016], is ongoing. Analysis The majority of the probable cases in Angola have been ruled out as yellow fever cases by the Institut Pasteur of Dakar. They will remain classified as probable cases until a full battery of tests has been run to determine other possible causes of illness. Once the final results are received the cases will be reclassified. Coincidentally, a previously scheduled pre-emptive vaccination campaign is ongoing in Kwanza Sul province where 2 new probable cases were reported. Epidemiological situation Angola 2 new probable cases without a history of yellow fever vaccination were reported from Kwanza Sul province in the last week. Of the 45 probable cases that were reported in the 4 weeks to 13 Oct [2016]: 31 have been discarded, 2 are undergoing further testing and 12 await classification by the committee (Fig. 1). From 5 Dec 2015 - 20 Oct 2016 (Table 1): - 4347 suspected cases, with 377 deaths (case fatality rate, CFR: 8.7 percent); - 884 cases have been laboratory confirmed, with 121 deaths (CFR: 13.7 percent). Since the start of the outbreak, suspected cases have been reported from all 18 provinces; confirmed cases have been reported from 80 districts in 16 provinces (Table 2). Autochthonous transmission has been reported from 45 districts in 12 provinces. Democratic Republic of the Congo From 1 Jan - 26 Oct 2016 (Fig. 2, Table 1): - 2987 notified cases reported from all 26 provinces; - 78 confirmed cases have been identified from 2800 suspected cases that have been laboratory tested, with 16 deaths (CFR: 21 percent); - Of the 78 confirmed cases, reported from 8 provinces (Fig. 4), 57 acquired infection in Angola, 13 are autochthonous, and 8 are cases of sylvatic transmission (not related to the outbreak). - One new confirmed, sylvatic case was reported from Bominenge Health Zone in Sud Ubangui province. This was one of the 16 probable cases that were reported under investigation last week. This new sylvatic case reportedly had symptom onset on 17 Aug [2016] 14 probable cases remain under investigation (3 in Kinshasa, 8 in Kwango and one case each in Bas Uele, Kwilu, and Lualaba provinces). In addition to the case in Sud Ubangui that was under investigation and is now classified as a new sylvatic case, one case in Kinshasa was ruled out due to previous yellow fever vaccination history. Response Information on the current outbreak continues to be updated on the WHO website. In Angola, phase 2 of the vaccination campaign targeting more than 2 million people in 12 districts in 10 provinces is ongoing. In Democratic Republic of the Congo, the reactive vaccination campaign in Feshi Health Zone in Kwango province ended after 152 492 people were vaccinated among a target of 146 449 (104.1 percent). The reactive campaign in Mushenge Health Zone in Kasai province which began on 20 Oct [2016] is ongoing. Monitoring continues in the 62 Health Zones where the pre-emptive vaccination campaigns were conducted in August [2016]. WHO has sent more than 30 million vaccine doses to Angola, Democratic Republic of the Congo and Uganda since the beginning of the outbreak through the International Coordinating Group (ICG) global stockpile, with additional vaccine doses from the manufacturer Bio-Manguinhos in Brazil. As of 25 Oct 2016, 20 million vaccine doses have been approved for Angola and 9.4 million doses for Democratic Republic of the Congo (Table 3). The number of vaccine doses currently available in the ICG global stockpile for emergency response is 6.9 million (Table 4). The amount of doses already allocated to respond to the outbreak is not included in this number. -- Communicated by: ProMED-mail [It is good to learn that 31 of the 45 probable cases in Angola and 1 of the 16 probable cases in the DR Congo have been confirmed, the latter as a sylvatic case.

Democratic Republic of the Congo epidemiological update (as of 26 Oct [2016]): - The last confirmed non-sylvatic case had symptom onset on 12 Jul [2016]. - A new confirmed, sylvatic case was reported from Bominenge Health Zone in Sud Ubangui province. - 14 probable cases remain under investigation. - The reactive campaign in Mushenge Health Zone in Kasai province, which began on 20 Oct [2016], is ongoing. Analysis The majority of the probable cases in Angola have been ruled out as yellow fever cases by the Institut Pasteur of Dakar. They will remain classified as probable cases until a full battery of tests has been run to determine other possible causes of illness. Once the final results are received the cases will be reclassified. Coincidentally, a previously scheduled pre-emptive vaccination campaign is ongoing in Kwanza Sul province where 2 new probable cases were reported. Epidemiological situation Angola 2 new probable cases without a history of yellow fever vaccination were reported from Kwanza Sul province in the last week. Of the 45 probable cases that were reported in the 4 weeks to 13 Oct [2016]: 31 have been discarded, 2 are undergoing further testing and 12 await classification by the committee (Fig. 1). From 5 Dec 2015 - 20 Oct 2016 (Table 1): - 4347 suspected cases, with 377 deaths (case fatality rate, CFR: 8.7 percent); - 884 cases have been laboratory confirmed, with 121 deaths (CFR: 13.7 percent). Since the start of the outbreak, suspected cases have been reported from all 18 provinces; confirmed cases have been reported from 80 districts in 16 provinces (Table 2). Autochthonous transmission has been reported from 45 districts in 12 provinces. Democratic Republic of the Congo From 1 Jan - 26 Oct 2016 (Fig. 2, Table 1): - 2987 notified cases reported from all 26 provinces; - 78 confirmed cases have been identified from 2800 suspected cases that have been laboratory tested, with 16 deaths (CFR: 21 percent); - Of the 78 confirmed cases, reported from 8 provinces (Fig. 4), 57 acquired infection in Angola, 13 are autochthonous, and 8 are cases of sylvatic transmission (not related to the outbreak). - One new confirmed, sylvatic case was reported from Bominenge Health Zone in Sud Ubangui province. This was one of the 16 probable cases that were reported under investigation last week. This new sylvatic case reportedly had symptom onset on 17 Aug [2016] 14 probable cases remain under investigation (3 in Kinshasa, 8 in Kwango and one case each in Bas Uele, Kwilu, and Lualaba provinces). In addition to the case in Sud Ubangui that was under investigation and is now classified as a new sylvatic case, one case in Kinshasa was ruled out due to previous yellow fever vaccination history. Response Information on the current outbreak continues to be updated on the WHO website. In Angola, phase 2 of the vaccination campaign targeting more than 2 million people in 12 districts in 10 provinces is ongoing. In Democratic Republic of the Congo, the reactive vaccination campaign in Feshi Health Zone in Kwango province ended after 152 492 people were vaccinated among a target of 146 449 (104.1 percent). The reactive campaign in Mushenge Health Zone in Kasai province which began on 20 Oct [2016] is ongoing. Monitoring continues in the 62 Health Zones where the pre-emptive vaccination campaigns were conducted in August [2016]. WHO has sent more than 30 million vaccine doses to Angola, Democratic Republic of the Congo and Uganda since the beginning of the outbreak through the International Coordinating Group (ICG) global stockpile, with additional vaccine doses from the manufacturer Bio-Manguinhos in Brazil. As of 25 Oct 2016, 20 million vaccine doses have been approved for Angola and 9.4 million doses for Democratic Republic of the Congo (Table 3). The number of vaccine doses currently available in the ICG global stockpile for emergency response is 6.9 million (Table 4). The amount of doses already allocated to respond to the outbreak is not included in this number. -- Communicated by: ProMED-mail [It is good to learn that 31 of the 45 probable cases in Angola and 1 of the 16 probable cases in the DR Congo have been confirmed, the latter as a sylvatic case.

But there have been no cases identified since 20 Oct 2016, she said. HFMD is a viral infection that can be spread through close personal contact, coughing or sneezing, contact with feces or sharing of straws, cups, and other contaminated surfaces. It is usually a mild, common childhood disease with limited consequences, according to CHCC. 'The viral illness usually affects infants and children younger than age 5. 'Of the 8 cases diagnosed at CHC in the last month, 5 or 63 percent were under the age of 5.' Sometimes adults can get the illness, but this is much less common. HFMD symptoms include a fever, reduced appetite and sore throat. One or 2 days after the fever, painful sores can develop in the mouth (called herpangina). They are usually in the back of the mouth as small red spots that blister and become ulcers. A skin rash with red spots and at times blisters can occur on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. 'Not everyone will develop all the symptoms. Some people may show no symptoms but still pass on the virus.' According to CHCC, 'A person with HFMD is most contagious during the 1st week of illness.' There is no vaccine for HFMD, but members of the public can prevent/reduce their risk of being infected by: - Washing their hands often with soap and water. - Cleaning and disinfecting touched surfaces including toys. - Avoid close contact including kissing, hugging, or sharing utensils/cups with a person suffering from HFMD. 'For the painful mouth sores, you can use over-the-counter mouthwashes or sprays that numb mouth pain. Take over-the-counter Tylenol or Ibuprofen to relieve pain and fever. Aspirin should not be given to children.' Community members are advised to stay home if they have HFMD. Talk to your primary care doctor if you are unsure when you should return to work.

4594469,PRO/AH/EDR> Peste des petits ruminants (02): FAO/OIE control/eradication campaign,2016-10-29 23:26:13,"PESTE DES PETITS RUMINANTS (02): FAO/OIE CONTROL/ERADICATION CAMPAIGN ********************************************************************* A ProMED-mail post ProMED-mail is a program of the International Society for Infectious Diseases Date: Fri 28 Oct 2016 Source: FAO news release [edited] The ground has been broken on a major international initiative to rid the world of peste des petits ruminants (PPR) -- also known as sheep and goat plague -- a highly contagious viral animal disease that causes major losses in regions home to millions of the world's poorest people. The USD 996.4-million plan launched by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) today [28 Oct 2016] is the 1st phase of what will be a 15-year effort to eradicate PPR by 2030. 'Wiping out PPR will have a major positive impact on the lives of pastoralist communities in all developing countries and directly support global efforts to end poverty and hunger by 2030,' FAO Director-General José Graziano da Silva said about the plan. 'When it comes to viral animal diseases, much attention falls on the threats they pose to human health -- but their effects on economic growth, human livelihoods, quality nutrition and food security can be equally devastating. That's why this campaign needs wide support,' he added. 'We have international standards for surveillance and diagnosis of PPR, a global system to report outbreaks, and standards for vaccines that are highly effective when applied appropriately,' OIE Director-General Monique Eloit said. 'We also have international standards to prevent spread through trade, to officially recognise the control programmes of our Members, and their status as free when those programmes achieve success,' she added. 'So all the tools are available to us, and are integrated into the plan. Its successful implementation now relies on the capacity of Veterinary Services at national level -- the OIE is committed to provide them with ongoing support.' Major losses ------------ Since it was 1st identified in Côte d'Ivoire in 1942, PPR has spread to some 70 countries in Africa, the Middle East and Asia -- in September 2016, Mongolia reported its 1st-ever case of PPR. Over 80 percent of the world's sheep and goats are found in these regions, where many families rely heavily on products like goat milk, mutton and wool for their nutrition and livelihoods. FAO estimates some 300 million small-scale farming families worldwide depend on small ruminants for food and income. To illustrate, a recent outbreak in India alone caused USD 180 million in losses, while a series of epidemics in Kenya in 2006-2008 killed 1.2 million small ruminants, causing losses exceeding USD 23.5 million and a drop in milk production of 2.1 million litres. In all, the annual global damage due to PPR is estimated to be between USD 1.4 billion and 2.1 billion. While the disease is highly lethal to small ruminants -- killing up to 90 percent of infected animals -- it is easily preventable with inexpensive vaccines that can be administered at low cost and will protect the animal for its entire life. The virus also has a relatively short infectious phase and does not survive for long outside a host, making it an ideal candidate for a concerted eradication effort. The plan for the 1st 5-year phase of that effort is now ready to be put into action and consists of a global strategy backed by 9 regional road maps. How it works ------------ The initial portion of the campaign is focused on countries where PPR is known to exist or where its status has never been assessed. It will involve activities to raise awareness among farmers, build their capacity to prevent and contain the disease, strengthen national veterinary health services and systems for control of PPR and other diseases, and implement targeted vaccination campaigns. But the plan goes beyond disease eradication alone -- it also aims to improve national production models and help herders build the strongest, most resilient livelihoods with their animal resources. With this approach, the agencies are looking to harness the potential of animal husbandry as a path out of poverty and valuable source of nutrition for poor families. Together, FAO and OIE will coordinate the global efforts of governments, regional organizations, research institutions, funding partners and livestock owners through the Joint PPR Global Secretariat, based in Rome. Replicating the success of the rinderpest strategy -------------------------------------------------- It is not the 1st time FAO and OIE join forces to rid the world of a costly plague. The PPR initiative is modelled on the successful effort to eradicate rinderpest, a similar disease affecting cattle, buffalo and wildlife, with global declaration of freedom in 2011. It was the 1st time an animal disease had been eradicated worldwide. The agencies' work on rinderpest not only showed that eradication of a major animal disease was possible and cost effective but also increased interest globally in how such efforts could be replicated to address other high impact diseases. Meeting growing demand ---------------------- With the world population set to rise to over 9.7 billion by 2050, small ruminant production is expected to rise with growing demand for meat and milk, growth that is generating new opportunities for producers, processers, and sellers. With that comes stronger interest from governments and industry to make supply chains more reliable and the movement of animals safer. A pledging conference to secure financial support for the 1st 5-year plan will be organized early next year [2017]. -- Communicated by: ProMED-mail [The described ambitious project could have become a subject in response to the launched initiative after the successful development and field application of a safe, homologous live vaccine.

4595554,"PRO/EDR> Influenza (44): narcolepsy, vaccine associated",2016-10-30 14:11:42,"INFLUENZA (44): NARCOLEPSY, VACCINE ASSOCIATED ********************************************** A ProMED-mail post ProMED-mail is a program of the International Society for Infectious Diseases Date: 28 Oct 2016 Source: MPR [edited] A multinational retrospective analysis failed to confirm a possible association between pediatric narcolepsy and the AS03- and MF-59-adjuvanted monovalent pandemic H1N1 vaccines, according to authors of a poster presentation at IDWeek 2016. However, geographic variation might have complicated efforts to assess such an association, and the study's statistical power for assessing risk after MF-59 vaccine was 'limited,' they cautioned. 'Overall, our results do not support an association between receipt of AS03-adjuvanted 2009 H1N1 vaccine and narcolepsy although our results are based almost exclusively on Arepanrix use in Ontario,' Steven Black, MD of the Center for Global Health, Cincinnati Children's Hospital, in Cincinnati, OH and coauthors reported in a poster presentation. In Europe, an increased risk of narcolepsy was reported among children administered the AS03-adjuvanted 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza vaccine, but that effect might have been influenced by news 'media attention bias,' the study authors noted. The international SOMNIA study was undertaken to evaluate the potential narcolepsy association with the AS03- and MF-59-adjuvanted monovalent pandemic H1N1 vaccines during 2003-2013. Narcolepsy incidence rates were assessed for the periods before, during, and after the pandemic influenza (A)H1N1 vaccination campaigns and a case-control analysis was undertaken to assess relative risks of narcolepsy among children and adults receiving the MF-59 and AS03 vaccines. 'No changes in incidence rates of narcolepsy diagnoses were observed between the period after the start of AS03- or MF-59-containing H1N1 vaccination programs and the period before H1N1 circulation in any of the age groups or countries except for Sweden, where a steep increase was observed in children 5-19 years in 2010,' the authors noted. 'In the primary case control analysis, no association was observed for AS03-containing vaccines in children or adults. Based on 3 exposed cases, an association with MF-59 vaccine was observed in Argentina in the primary analysis in children, but no association was found when cases from Europe were included.' The study is funded by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). -- Communicated by: ProMED-mail [In response to the 2009 swine flu H1N1 pandemic, 2 separate pharmaceutical companies developed vaccines: Pandemrix, produced by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), and Focetria, created by Novartis. But the former vaccine was associated with an unusual increase in cases of narcolepsy; a chronic and incurable brain disorder that disrupts sleep-wake cycles and causes an array of symptoms, including overwhelming daytime sleepiness and sleep attacks that can strike at any time, even in the middle of a conversation. No such relationship was observed in populations that received Focetria, which was manufactured using a different H1N1 strain []. Pandemrix contains an oil-in-water emulsion adjuvant called ASO3. Adjuvants are substances added to a vaccine to increase the body's immune response to that vaccine []. In 2014, CDC published a study on the association between 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccines, 2010/2011 seasonal influenza vaccines, and narcolepsy. The analysis included more than 650 000 people who received the pandemic flu vaccine in 2009 and over 870 000 people who received the seasonal flu vaccine in 2010/2011. The study found that vaccination was not associated with an increased risk for narcolepsy []. According to a new study published in Science Translational Medicine, the vaccine triggered the generation of antibodies that targeted both the virus and a population of brain cells critical to the regulation of sleep-wake cycles. This intriguing finding supports earlier suggestions that narcolepsy may be the result of an autoimmune reaction, where the body accidentally attacks itself. These suspicions were aroused after scientists discovered that a significant portion of disease sufferers with narcolepsy accompanied by cataplexy, a condition that causes sudden episodes of muscle weakness, carry a gene variant called HLA-DQB1*0602, which codes for a receptor found on the surface of immune cells. Additionally, narcoleptics seem to generate higher levels of antibodies to pathogens following infection. Another important observation is that the brains of narcolepsy patients seem to have fewer neurons responsible for the generation of a signaling chemical called hypocretin that, when attached to its corresponding receptor, helps maintain wakefulness. Consequently, narcoleptics also have less hypocretin in their brains []. Researchers from Stanford University found that a portion of one of H1N1's proteins closely resembles a portion of the hypocretin receptor. While this protein was found in both vaccines, it was present in significantly higher concentrations in Pandemrix. This led to the possibility that the antibodies generated as a result of the vaccine could be cross-reactive, attacking both their viral target and the hypocretin receptor, thereby triggering an autoimmune reaction []. To evaluate this hypothesis, the researchers examined the blood of 20 individuals who developed narcolepsy following immunization with Pandemrix and compared them to 6 controls vaccinated with Focetria. Piecing together the clues, they found that 17 of those in the Pandemrix group had abnormally high levels of hypocretin receptor antibodies, whereas the controls did not. The team, therefore, proposes that in those genetically predisposed to the condition, the H1N1 protein that was present in high levels in Pandemrix, but not Focetria, successfully triggered the production of antibodies to the virus, but that these also bind to the hypocretin receptor. This could potentially initiate a targeted immune response towards the hypocretin cells, triggering their destruction and thus disrupting the regulation of sleep-wake cycles. - Mod.UBA] [See Also: Influenza (43): USA (OH) H3N2 variant outbreak 20161030.4592086 Influenza (42): Sweden, vaccine efficacy study 20161030.4592085 Influenza (41): WHO global update, seasonal 20161025.4583056 Influenza (40): Mexico (AG) seasonal surge 20161014.4559640 Influenza (39): WHO global update, seasonal 20161009.4547828 Influenza (38): WHO global update, seasonal 20160921.4505854 Influenza (37): WHO global update, seasonal 20160910.4478421 Influenza (36): Australia (WA) case surge 20160901.4454240 Influenza (35): seasonal, WHO global update 20160827.4445283 Influenza (34): seasonal, impact of influenza B 20160821.4431011 Influenza (33): Australia (NS) seasonal activity surge 20160817.4420409 Influenza (32): WHO global update, seasonal 20160810.4404144 Influenza (31): Panama, H1N1 20160806.4383921 Influenza (30): WHO global update, seasonal 20160726.4370090 Influenza (29): South America activity levels 20160716.4348875 Influenza (27): WHO global update, seasonal 20160715.4344014 Influenza (26): WHO global update, seasonal 20160630.4317933 Influenza (25): WHO global update, seasonal 20160616.4290476 Influenza (24): seasonal, WHO global update 20160603.4262742 Influenza (23): seasonal, WHO global update, USA (TN) unusual local surge 20160521.4236158 Influenza (20): seasonal, WHO global update 20160421.4173579 Influenza (19): UK, impact of vaccine mismatch, comment 20160411.4152610 Influenza (18): UK, impact of vaccine mismatch 20160410.4146702 Influenza (17): Mexico, Kosovo, Peru, case surge 20160401.4124407 Influenza (16): UK, USA, high activity 20160328.4122414 Influenza (15): seasonal, WHO global update 20160323.4114051 Influenza (14): WHO update on vaccine candidates for zoonotic influenza 20160320.4106795 Influenza (13): ECDC summary, WHO update 20160313.4090542 Influenza (12): China (HK) seasonal, influenza B 20160313.4088935 Influenza (11): flu news, sit rep, Ukraine, Georgia, H1N1, H3N2 20160223.4045191 Influenza (10): WHO update, risk assessment, Ukraine, E Europe, Middle East H1N1 20160210.4007591 Influenza (09): USA, CDC alert, Russia 20160202.3988739 Influenza (07): Egypt (BH) H1N1 20160124.3962173 Influenza (06): USA (WA), Eastern Europe, increased cases H1N1 20160123.3960019 Influenza (04): Turkey, H1N1 20160114.3936792 Influenza (01): India (MH) H1N1 20160103.3907597 2015 ---- Influenza (38): vaccine and narcolepsy, new hypothesis 20150711.3503481 2013 ---- Influenza (71): Sweden, Pandemrix vaccine & narcolepsy 20131224.2135116 Influenza (22): pandemic vaccine & narcolepsy 20130227.1562668 2012 ---- Influenza (89): France, narcolepsy in H1N1-vaccinated adults 20120922.1305056 2011 ---- Influenza (49): China, narcolepsy 20110823.2561 Influenza (45): vaccine & narcolepsy 20110723.2210 Influenza (12): narcolepsy and vaccination 20110210.0463 2010 ---- Influenza pandemic (H1N1) (66): Sweden, no vaccine narcolepsy link 20100914.3322] .................................................sb/mpp/uba/msp/mpp",Vaccine Complication,Worldwide,75,-39.990234,Humans

In humans, consumption of unpasteurized milk products from infected animals is thought to be a common source of infection; however, human-to-human, airborne transmission from patients with _M. bovis_ pulmonary tuberculosis is also possible (Lobue PA, et al. Int J Tuberc Lung Dis 2004; 8: 868-72), and from other animals with _M. bovis_pulmonary tuberculosis, as presumably was the case in the news report above. Accurate speciation of isolates from clinical specimens is important for epidemiologic and clinical reasons. However, very frequently, a clinical isolate is only identified as '_M. tuberculosis_ complex,' and pyrazinamide resistance is not routinely performed. In such circumstances, the standard 6-month, short-course combination drug therapy for TB, which includes pyrazinamide, is likely to fail, as the 6-month, short-course regimen depends on the rapid bactericidal action of pyrazinamide; without this drug as part of an effective initial regimen, therapy must be prolonged beyond 6 months. Human infection caused by _M. bovis_ has been mostly, but not completely, eradicated in the USA by the use of pasteurization of milk and culling of herds shown positive on tuberculin skin testing, starting in about 1917. _M. bovis_ human infection continues to be reported in the USA. Bovine tuberculosis is endemic in Latin America, including Mexico (Milian F, et al. Rev Latinoam Microbiol. 2000; 42: 13-9). In the US, TB due to _M. bovis_ continues to be reported, primarily in immigrants who acquire the infection in their countries of origin where _M. bovis_ infection remains endemic, or in persons of Hispanic ethnicity as a consequence of ingesting dairy foods made from unpasteurized milk of _M. bovis_-infected cows and smuggled across the Mexico-U.S. border (1,2). People of Hispanic ethnicity and consumption of unpasteurized milk products produced in Latin America are not restricted to states of the USA bordering Mexico. An investigation in New York City identified 35 cases of tuberculosis due to _M. bovis_ during 2001-4; 19 of the 23 interviewed patients reported eating cheese produced in Mexico while they were living in the USA (3). In this investigation, of the 35 isolates, 14 were resistant to streptomycin, one was resistant to INH [isoniazid], and 2 were resistant to INH and streptomycin, in addition to being resistant to pyrazinamide. Thus, accurate speciation of clinical isolates identified as '_M. tuberculosis_ complex' and drug susceptibility testing are important throughout the country. 1.

Canine brucellosis is a reproductive disease that affects dogs, according to the United States Department of Agriculture. Several animals from the rescue have been infected by the [bacterium], according to a press release from the organization. Gregory's said anyone who has adopted a dog between 15 Jun 2015 and 1 Sep 2016 should have the animal tested with their current veterinarian. All dogs were considered exposed to the [bacterium] by the Wisconsin statute regarding zoonotic diseases. 'Although it is very rare, it can cause devastation when it is diagnosed,' the release said. The rescue has closed its boarding services and dog adoption to be proactive of the possible spread of the [bacterium]. Rescue personnel became aware of the exposure after an adopted dog was diagnosed with the [bacterium]. 'We remind people this is a population problem (the animals themselves) not a facility issue, so when we re-open, there is no concern for spreading of the [bacteria],' Gregory's press release stated. As a no-kill shelter, Gregory's said it is having each of its dogs tested and put through the quarantine period rather than euthanization as many other shelters would. 'Being the only operating animal shelter in the county and being placed in this position has been very hard on all of us here at the organization as well as the animals in need in our communities,' the rescue said in its release. Though the dog population is quarantined, Gregory's is continuing to help rescue cats in the area. The rescue is currently running a cat adoption special through the end of October 2016. 'With the weather turning, we are in great need of having forever homes found so we can continue to help those in need during the hard cold fall and winter months,' the release stated.

[Byline: Rebecca Mariscal] -- Communicated by: ProMED-mail [_Brucella melitensis_, _suis_ and _abortus_ species exhibit either rough (R) or smooth (S) colonies on growth in the lab, determined by expression of O-polysaccharide chain as a component of the bacterial outer membrane lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (endotoxin). Loss of expression of O chains results in rough colonial variants. _B. canis_ lack the O chain naturally and only has a rough colonial form. The virulence of _Brucella_ for humans is mainly associated with smooth colonial phenotypes of _B. melitensis_, _suis_, and _abortus_, and conventional serological techniques (that is, agglutination tests) use smooth phase antigens that will diagnose infection due to _B. abortus_, _B. melitensis_, and _B. suis_, but are not useful for diagnosing infections caused by the rough species (_B. ovis_ and _B. canis_) in humans or dogs. For additional information on brucellosis see: _B. suis_ in dogs: and . Canine brucellosis, caused by _Brucella canis_, is an important cause of reproductive failure, particularly in kennels. This organism causes abortions, stillbirths, epididymitis [inflammation of ducts next to the testicle], orchitis [inflammation of the testicle] and sperm abnormalities in dogs. Although dogs that have been spayed or neutered do not have reproductive signs, they occasionally develop other conditions such as ocular disease and discospondylitis (inflammation of the spinal vertebrae and intervertebral discs). _B. canis_ can persist in an animal even after antibiotic treatment. In kennels, infected dogs are often euthanized to prevent them from infecting other dogs or people. Canine brucellosis is sometimes difficult to diagnose with the currently available tests. Although _B. canis_ is zoonotic, its importance as a cause of human illness is still unclear. Few cases have been reported in people, and most of these infections have been mild. However, human infections with _B. canis_ may be underdiagnosed. The symptoms of this disease are nonspecific, diagnostic suspicion is low among physicians, and bacterial culture is the only commonly available test for diagnosis in people. _B. canis_ occurs in the fetus, placenta, fetal fluids, and vaginal discharge after an abortion or stillbirth. It can persist in vaginal discharges for several weeks after an abortion. It is also shed in normal vaginal secretions, particularly during estrus, as well as in milk. High concentrations of _B. canis_ may be found in semen for weeks or months after infection, and intermittent shedding of smaller quantities can occur for years. _B. canis_ is also shed in urine, and low concentrations of bacteria may be excreted in saliva, nasal and ocular secretions and feces. In dogs, _B. canis_ primarily enters the body by ingestion and through the genital, oronasal and conjunctival mucosa, but transmission through broken skin may also be possible. Most cases are thought to be acquired by venereal transmission or by contact with the fetus and fetal membranes after abortions and stillbirths. Puppies can be infected in utero, and may remain persistently infected even if they appear normal. Nursing puppies can be infected from milk, but the importance of this route is controversial. Other potential sources of infection include blood transfusions and contaminated syringes. _B. canis_ can be spread on fomites. In conditions of high humidity, low temperatures and no sunlight, _Brucella_ spp can remain viable for several months in water, aborted fetuses, feces, equipment, and clothing. _Brucella_ spp can withstand drying, particularly when organic material is present, and can survive in dust and soil. Survival is longer when the temperature is low, particularly when it is below freezing. Humans usually become infected with members of the genus _Brucella_ by ingesting organisms or via the contamination of mucous membranes and abraded skin. In case reports, _B. canis_ infections have been described after close contact with dogs, especially animals that recently aborted or gave birth, and after exposure to large amounts of the organism in laboratories (such as, contact with bacterial cultures). However, the source of the organism could not be determined in some cases. While documented human cases of _B. canis_ are rare, and may be underreported, immunocompromised people should be especially careful around animals known to be positive for _B. canis_. Portions of this comment were extracted from . _Brucella canis_ in dogs is not common, but nor is it rare. Gerald Hoff found that 4% of Florida pound dogs had positive titres of 1:200 or higher; see Brucella canis, dogs, retrospective - USA (Florida) 19980518.0954.

Hearing loss appears to be linked to Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) caused by vaccination ------------------------------------ Sudden Hearing Loss in an Adolescent Patient. When is it an emergency? By J Gurley, C Hill, S Haley, and C Bailey. Hearing loss is common in all ages and has 3 main categories: conductive, sensorineural and mixed. The leading causes of conductive hearing loss are cerumen impaction, otitis media and otosclerosis. The main causes of sensorineural hearing loss include inherited disorders, noise exposure and presbycusis. (1) This adolescent case study focuses on diagnosis of a potentially complex hearing loss etiology. Clinical Presentation ---------------------- Mary is a 17-year-old, white adolescent teen who developed sudden hearing loss in the right ear, along with a burning sensation and a vesicular rash behind the same right ear. She reported acute hearing loss 2 days subsequent to the rash. Mary denies any trauma to head or ear. Past Medical History ---------------- Mary has not had the chickenpox because she had 2 doses of the Varicella vaccine. The weakened Varicella vaccine can reactivate in rare instances to cause herpes zoster (HZ). (2) It is also assumed that a decline in cell-mediated immunity may play a critical role in the reactivation of the weakened Varicella vaccine. (3) Mary denies HIV, asplenia and medication use at this time. Therefore, she has no history of past or present immunosuppression. There is no family history of inherited sensorineural hearing loss or gradual hearing loss over time. Mary denies the use of headphones and has never attended a concert. Mary does admit to listening to music in her car loudly. Mary denies use of alcohol or illicit drugs and has no known drug allergies. Mary is up to date with all state required immunizations. She and her mother presented to ambulatory acute care awake, alert and oriented to person, place, and time. Mary's vital signs were blood pressure, 98/62; heart rate, 86 beats per minute and regular; afebrile; respiratory rate of 16 saturating at 98% on room air, and weight, 120 lbs. A complete blood count and blood chemistry were done to rule out any immunocompromised state. A Varicella titer was also performed to confirm whether there were any Varicella antibodies indicating immunity to varicella. A Physical Examination -------------- Objective findings included a 3cm by 2cm unilateral, red, and raised vesicular rash behind her right ear. Surrounding skin was red and inflamed. Some vesicles were oozing yellow serous fluid from Mary scratching the area. Otoscopic evaluation revealed redness and vesicles inside the right ear canal. There was scant cerumen in both ears. Mary's tympanic membrane was pearly grey with boney landmarks visible. There was no abnormal bone growth seen in the middle ear. A tuning fork was used to perform the Weber hearing test. Mary was able to feel the vibrations in her left ear, which suggested the possibility of sensorineural hearing lost. Diagnosis --------- Sudden Sensoneural Hearing Loss (SSNHL) Secondary to HZ, also known as shingles, is caused by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV). (2) HZ is an illness triggered by the reactivation of VZV, which lies dormant in sensory ganglia after primary infection. (3) Clinically, HZ is usually evidenced by unilateral radicular pain and vesicular eruptions limited to a single dermatome innervated by a single spinal or cranial sensory ganglion. (4) The incidence and severity of HZ disease increases with age, with a noticeable rise after 50 years of age, however, although relatively rare, HZ also occurs in children. (5) Sadly, there is not enough data at this point to assess whether the varicella vaccine, which became available in 1995, is consistently associated with milder cases of chicken pox and fewer occurrences of shingles later in life. (6) Studies have shown that one dose of the varicella vaccine has been effective at preventing 85% of varicella cases. (6) It is estimated that one million people annually are affected with HZ. (3) HZ-associated pain tends to resolve over time, but some patients suffer from post neuropathic pain beyond resolution of visible cutaneous manifestations. (2) Making a Referral -------------- The decision to refer Mary to the next level of care was made when vesicles were found inside the ear canal along with hearing loss. The referral was made to try to keep Mary's hearing intact. Mary was referred to urgent care because SSNHL is one of the few emergencies in otology. (5) This emergency is also a terrifying experience for patients as they lose the ability to effectively communicate. (5) Sudden sensorineural hearing loss is a rather common otologic disorder characterized by newly onset unilateral or bilateral hearing loss that develops rapidly, within 72 hours. (5) Viral infections such as HZ can lead to SSNHL. (5) Studies showing the connection between HZ and SSHNL are lacking at this time. (5) Therefore, no definitive numbers can be assigned for the incidence in adolescents. Follow-up -------- During a follow up call the next day, it was learned that Mary was diagnosed with herpes zoster. She was diagnosed by clinical presentation alone. A Varicella titer was performed to prove the antibodies of the vaccination were present, which they weren't due to varicella vaccination. Mary was placed on Valtrex 1000mg by mouth 3 times a day for 7 days, Tylenol #3 30mg/300mg every 8 hours as needed for pain, and prednisone dose pack starting at 60mg and tapering off over 2 weeks. It is recommended for HZ to be treated with antiviral agents, pain medication and corticosteroids for pain control. (7) Mary was given an appointment to follow-up one week after completion of Valtrex with her ear, nose, and throat specialist and instructed to go directly to ED if symptoms worsened. Conclusion ---------- Proper and prompt referral is vital to the improved outcomes of adolescents who present with HZ symptoms affecting organs vital to communication. It is key to remember that prompt treatment of disease can deter hearing loss. (1) Recovery is variable, and patients with more severe losses display poorer recovery of hearing since the hearing loss is due to degeneration in the cochlear nerve, as well as inflammation around the brain lining. (1) Therefore, it is important to remember to educate patients on importance of up-to-date immunizations and early treatment of diseases, which can also lower the chances of hearing loss. (1) Since there aren't many large studies on the connection of HZ and SSNHL, additional DNP capstone research should be conducted to collect more information on this topic. -- Communicated by: ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts [See URL above for references. Varicella zoster virus (VZV) can cause hearing loss in both children and adults. A child who gets chickenpox may be at higher risk for an ear infection, and hearing loss, but it rarely happens. In adults older than 60, the chickenpox virus can reactivate itself in a condition known as shingles (herpes zoster). One symptom of shingles is hearing loss. If an adult has not been vaccinated for shingles, the virus can also reactivate in a rare disease called Ramsay Hunt syndrome. Ramsay Hunt affects the nerve near the inner ear and causes a painful rash. This painful rash can happen on the eardrum, ear canal, or the earlobe. The syndrome produces weakness of the face on one side of the face. In addition, generally, temporary hearing loss can happen in one ear. Treatment involves steroids or antiviral drugs (Excerpted from ). But the patient in the report was 17 years old, vaccinated, with no known immune deficiencies; thus, it is not clear what may have precipitated the hearing loss. Children with no apparent immune problems who had chickenpox before they were one year old also have a higher risk for shingles. Perhaps she experienced a subclinical VZV infection that broke through the immunity. - Mod.LK] [See Also: Varicella - USA (04): (MI) 20160910.4479405 Varicella - Nepal: (KT) seasonality 20160803.4391076 Varicella - Colombia: (ME) prison 20160729.4377832 Varicella - USA (03): (CA) shingles 20160727.4371715 Varicella (04): inverse relationship with glioma 20160604.4265732 Varicella (03): USA (New York City), India (New Delhi) 20160519.4233123 Varicella - USA: (MI) 20160501.4195072 Varicella - India (02): (PB) 20160415.4158643 Varicella, MRSA - USA: (MI,PA) school children 20160403.4135512 Varicella: Caribbean (Grenada), USA (NC) schoolchildren 20160308.4078236 Varicella-zoster vaccine-associated keratitis: RFI 20160303.4067633 Varicella - India: (WB) law school students 20160208.40044892015 ---- Chickenpox - Nepal (02): (BN) 20150908.3631748 Chickenpox - Nepal: (KT) post-earthquake 20150505.3343420 2014 ---- Chickenpox - India (03): (OR) fatal 20141109.2941349 Chickenpox - India (02): (JH) 20140520.2484869 Chickenpox - India: (MP) 20140516.2477950 Chickenpox - Thailand: children 20140210.2268350 2012 ---- Chickenpox - India (02): (Chennai) 20120415.1102085 Chickenpox- India: (Mumbai) 20120225.1052634 2011 ---- Chickenpox, children - India (02): (AS) 20110513.1467 Chickenpox, children - India: (AS) 20110511.1453] .................................................sb/lk/msp/mpp",Chicken Pox,Worldwide,75,-39.990234,Humans

'We wanted to make sure that list gets bigger.' --However, if there are no volunteers at any given time of need, the hospital is then allowed to assign employees. --Anyone who ends up being quarantined after providing care to a patient will continue to be paid during their quarantine. --Training for handling new pandemics will be ongoing, so any updated advice from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will quickly be conveyed to health care workers. --The USD 3000 tuition reimbursement available for every employee will be increased by USD 700, while those who use it will have to commit to remaining at the hospital another year.] [It is good the contract has the foresight to plan for new pandemics rather than focus solely on EVD. - Mod.LK] 27 Oct 2016 Sierra Leone: New report highlights fragile state of food security in Sierra Leone after Ebola outbreak The State of Food Insecurity in Sierra Leone report launched today [27 Oct 2016] by the Government of Sierra Leone, the United Nations World Food Program (WFP) and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) shows more than half of the population -- over 3.5 million people -- are food insecure, without access to a sufficient amount of safe and nutritious food. Of these, about 600 000 are severely food insecure, eating significantly less food and less varied and nutritious food, and unable to cope with new shocks such as drought, floods and fluctuating food prices. The number of severely food insecure people has increased by 60 percent since 2010. There are over 34 000 households across Sierra Leone's 149 chiefdoms and 18 urban wards, making it the largest food security assessment of its kind in the country.

Berge T, Lubuma JM, Moremedi GM, et al. (22 Sep 2016). J Biological Dynamics. 11 (1), 2017 Abstract. We deal with the following question: Can the consumption of contaminated bush meat, the funeral practices and the environmental contamination explain the recurrence and persistence of Ebola virus disease outbreaks in Africa? We develop an SIR-type model which, incorporates both the direct and indirect transmissions in such a manner that there is a provision of Ebola viruses. We prove that the full model has one (endemic) equilibrium which is locally asymptotically stable whereas, it is globally asymptotically stable in the absence of the Ebola virus shedding in the environment. For the sub-model without the provision of Ebola viruses, the disease dies out or stabilizes globally at an endemic equilibrium. At the endemic level, the number of infections is larger for the full model than for the sub-model without provision of Ebola viruses. We design a nonstandard finite difference scheme, which preserves the dynamics of the model. Numerical simulations are provided. ...[more] 8 Sep 2016: Trojan Horse antibody attacks Ebola type filoviruses into carrying the means of their own destruction. [In a research effort funded by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency's Joint Science and Technology Office, researchers from the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID), Integrated BioTherapeutics Inc., Vanderbilt University Medical Center and The Scripps Research Institute discovered a new strategy for defeating all 5 strands of EBOV to protect war-fighters and civilians. 'Often fatal, [Ebola virus disease (EVD)] is a disease with no FDA-approved vaccines or treatments. The situation is complicated by 5 viral strains, 4 of which cause harm to humans. However, research supported by 2 JSTO projects has created a novel medical countermeasure design. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are promising treatments for EBOV patients, but most mAb therapies target individual strains of EBOV with limited effectiveness against the other strains. A research team, led by Dr. John Dye of USAMRIID, sought to discover an effective medical countermeasure for all EBOV strains. The team discovered the Achilles' heel of EBOV [Ebola virus]: It must bind to a host-cell protein called Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) and multiply in human cells. This new therapeutic strategy targets the weakness shared by all EBOV types. One of the novel antibodies produced under this strategy protected mice against the 2 most lethal strains, Ebola Zaire and Ebola Sudan. The team deceived EBOV into carrying the means of its own destruction into cells by synthesizing 2 types of 'bispecific' antibodies (bsAbs), each consisting of 2 mAbs combined into one molecule. One bsAb neutralized the viral protein that binds to NPC1 [Niemann-Pick disease, type C1], the other targeted NPC1. Both had one mAb in common, FVM09, which binds all EBOV while the virus is outside cells, allowing the bsAbs to ride the virus into the cell. Because the engineered bsAbs block endosomal receptor binding by all filoviruses, combining them with delivery mAbs of viral or cellular origin could afford coverage against all filoviruses, including emerging or engineered variants. Researcher Dr. Kartik Chandran hopes to extend the 'Trojan horse' strategy beyond EBOV for increased warfighter protection. 'We hope that our 'Trojan horse' antibody strategy of targeting viruses in lysosomes might work against other disease-causing viruses like flu, dengue, or Lassa, which, like Ebola, also enter host-cell lysosomes as part of their life cycles. This breakthrough will increase protection for the warfighter against naturally occurring or engineered viruses.'] [Seems like an innovative approach that shows some promise. - Mod.LK] 27 Oct 2016: Preparation and response to the 2014 Ebola virus disease epidemic in Nigeria--The experience of a tertiary hospital in Nigeria [Citation.

Wiley Online Library. DOI: 10.1111/tmi.12802 Abstract. ---Objectives A central pillar in the response to the 2014 Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) epidemic in Sierra Leone was the role of Ebola Holding Units (EHUs). These units isolated patients meeting a suspect case definition, tested them for EVD, initiated appropriate early treatment, and discharged negative patients to onward inpatient care or home. Positive patients were referred to Ebola Treatment Centers. We aimed to estimate the risk of nosocomial transmission within these EHUs. ---Results We found a positive readmission rate of 3.3 percent (18 cases), which included 1.5 percent confirmed readmissions (8 cases) and 1.8 percent possible readmissions (10 cases). This is lower than rates previously reported. We cannot ascertain whether EVD was acquired within the EHUs or from re-exposure in the community. No demographic or clinical variables were identified as risk factors for positive readmission, likely due to our small sample size. ---Conclusions These findings support the EHU model as a safe method for isolation of suspect EVD patients and their role in limiting the spread of EVD.] [Compiled by: Celeste Whitlow ] -- Communicated by: ProMED-mail [A map showing the distribution of EVD cases can be seen at: .

4596196,PRO/EDR> Acute flaccid myelitis - North America (05): USA,2016-10-30 21:55:47,"ACUTE FLACCID MYELITIS - NORTH AMERICA (05): USA ************************************************ A ProMED-mail post ProMED-mail is a program of the International Society for Infectious Diseases Date: Fri 28 Oct 2016 Source: Seattle Times [edited] Eight children in Western Washington have been hospitalized this fall [2016] with acute neurologic illnesses, and health investigators are trying to determine whether the children are suffering from an extremely rare syndrome that causes varying degrees of paralysis similar to polio. The children had a range of types and severity of symptoms, but all had a loss of strength or movement in one or more arms or legs. Doctors emphasized the syndrome is not contagious. National health experts have reported an uptick nationwide this year [2016] in acute flaccid myelitis (AFM), a syndrome that affects the nervous system -- specifically the spinal cord -- and can affect both children and adults. The Washington cases have not been confirmed as AFM but are being investigated as such. Dr. Jim Owens, a pediatric neurologist at Seattle Children's, described it as 'a body's response to common infections,' adding, 'it's a really rare thing.' According to the state Department of Health, the exact cause of AFM is unknown. Many viruses and germs are linked to the syndrome, including common germs that can cause colds and sore throats, as well as respiratory infections. It can also be caused by poliovirus and non-polio enteroviruses, mosquito-borne viruses (including West Nile virus and Zika virus) and autoimmune conditions. The health department is leading an investigation into the cases with Public Health - Seattle & King County, Seattle Children's and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In Washington, 3 of the children are currently hospitalized at Seattle Children's, and 5 have been released. The 1st case was seen in mid-September 2016, the latest in mid-October 2016. A 9th Washington case, in an adult, was recorded in the spring. Three of the children are from King County; one is from Pierce County; 2 are from Franklin County, and 2 are from Whatcom County. They range in age from 3-14. Nationwide, the CDC says 50 confirmed cases of AFM have been reported this year [2016] in 24 states, although it did not identify the states. Washington state had 2 cases in 2014 and none in 2015. Dr. Scott Lindquist, infectious disease epidemiologist at the state Department of Health, said he is not convinced that all 8 cases in Washington will turn out to be AFM, and, at this point, there is no evidence leading to a single source. Still, 'I am concerned,' he said. 'To be very frank about it, it is very unusual to have a clustering of these cases so close together, and I'm concerned we don't have answers yet.' Owens, the pediatric neurologist at Seattle Children's, said the degree of recovery from AFM is 'variable,' but that in general, patients do not fully recover from it. He said patients with the illness come in with weakness in their limbs, and an MRI typically will reveal inflammation in the spinal cord. Doctors treat it with drugs that decrease inflammation, such as steroids. It can take doctors a while to come to a diagnosis, which is why it remains unknown whether any of the 8 cases of neurologic illness in the Washington children are AFM. 'It's entirely possible none of these cases will be AFM,' Owens said. The CDC's experts will review the Washington MRIs to determine whether they show the distinctive lesions in certain areas of the spinal cord that are characteristic of AFM. Owens said children who have the syndrome have a noticeably significant weakness in a limb, and it develops quickly, in hours or a day. 'We're not talking about just a little bit of weakness; we're talking about not moving their arm at all,' he said. 'This is extremely uncommon, and the symptoms are not subtle.' In extreme cases, AFM can cause difficulty with breathing and swallowing, he said, but it is not generally fatal. A parent who is concerned that their child is showing sudden weakness in an arm or leg should call their pediatrician's office, he said. Dr. Mark Del Beccaro, chief medical officer at Seattle Children's, sought to assure parents that it is safe to bring their children to the hospital. 'We are following our standard infection-control protocols, including putting patients with symptoms of active respiratory infections in isolation so they do not have contact with any other patients,' he said in a statement. Owens said all of the patients who came to Children's with the symptoms developed them outside of the hospital. On its website, the CDC has expressed concern about the increase of incidents in 2016. 'We know there has been an increase in these cases,' Lindquist said. 'We were all on alert.' He described the quick identification of the cluster as a success story because it was recognized and reported so quickly by doctors at Children's. The CDC said 21 cases were reported in 2014, the 1st year that national reporting of the syndrome began. Reporting of AFM is voluntary in most states, so it is difficult to interpret trends, the CDC said, but greater awareness among health-care providers may be one reason for the uptick. Owens said a group of cases occurred in the intermountain region of the Western U.S., near Colorado, in 2014, and the CDC raised awareness among physicians to begin looking for the syndrome and reporting it. The CDC recommends that children and adults be up to date on vaccinations, avoid being bitten by mosquitoes, and wash hands often. [Byline: Katherine Long] -- Communicated by: Chris Noell and ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts [See ProMED-mail post 'Acute flaccid myelitis - North America (04): USA 20161015.4562409' for a discussion of AFM. A number of different viruses are believed to trigger AFM, including enteroviruses (e.g., poliovirus), non-polio enteroviruses (EV-D68), adenoviruses and the flaviviruses, West Nile virus and Zika virus, as well as autoimmune conditions. Without identification of the etiologic agent, one doesn't know whether the causative agent can be transmitted between humans or not.

4596196,PRO/EDR> Acute flaccid myelitis - North America (05): USA,2016-10-30 21:55:47,"ACUTE FLACCID MYELITIS - NORTH AMERICA (05): USA ************************************************ A ProMED-mail post ProMED-mail is a program of the International Society for Infectious Diseases Date: Fri 28 Oct 2016 Source: Seattle Times [edited] Eight children in Western Washington have been hospitalized this fall [2016] with acute neurologic illnesses, and health investigators are trying to determine whether the children are suffering from an extremely rare syndrome that causes varying degrees of paralysis similar to polio. The children had a range of types and severity of symptoms, but all had a loss of strength or movement in one or more arms or legs. Doctors emphasized the syndrome is not contagious. National health experts have reported an uptick nationwide this year [2016] in acute flaccid myelitis (AFM), a syndrome that affects the nervous system -- specifically the spinal cord -- and can affect both children and adults. The Washington cases have not been confirmed as AFM but are being investigated as such. Dr. Jim Owens, a pediatric neurologist at Seattle Children's, described it as 'a body's response to common infections,' adding, 'it's a really rare thing.' According to the state Department of Health, the exact cause of AFM is unknown. Many viruses and germs are linked to the syndrome, including common germs that can cause colds and sore throats, as well as respiratory infections. It can also be caused by poliovirus and non-polio enteroviruses, mosquito-borne viruses (including West Nile virus and Zika virus) and autoimmune conditions. The health department is leading an investigation into the cases with Public Health - Seattle & King County, Seattle Children's and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In Washington, 3 of the children are currently hospitalized at Seattle Children's, and 5 have been released. The 1st case was seen in mid-September 2016, the latest in mid-October 2016. A 9th Washington case, in an adult, was recorded in the spring. Three of the children are from King County; one is from Pierce County; 2 are from Franklin County, and 2 are from Whatcom County. They range in age from 3-14. Nationwide, the CDC says 50 confirmed cases of AFM have been reported this year [2016] in 24 states, although it did not identify the states. Washington state had 2 cases in 2014 and none in 2015. Dr. Scott Lindquist, infectious disease epidemiologist at the state Department of Health, said he is not convinced that all 8 cases in Washington will turn out to be AFM, and, at this point, there is no evidence leading to a single source. Still, 'I am concerned,' he said. 'To be very frank about it, it is very unusual to have a clustering of these cases so close together, and I'm concerned we don't have answers yet.' Owens, the pediatric neurologist at Seattle Children's, said the degree of recovery from AFM is 'variable,' but that in general, patients do not fully recover from it. He said patients with the illness come in with weakness in their limbs, and an MRI typically will reveal inflammation in the spinal cord. Doctors treat it with drugs that decrease inflammation, such as steroids. It can take doctors a while to come to a diagnosis, which is why it remains unknown whether any of the 8 cases of neurologic illness in the Washington children are AFM. 'It's entirely possible none of these cases will be AFM,' Owens said. The CDC's experts will review the Washington MRIs to determine whether they show the distinctive lesions in certain areas of the spinal cord that are characteristic of AFM. Owens said children who have the syndrome have a noticeably significant weakness in a limb, and it develops quickly, in hours or a day. 'We're not talking about just a little bit of weakness; we're talking about not moving their arm at all,' he said. 'This is extremely uncommon, and the symptoms are not subtle.' In extreme cases, AFM can cause difficulty with breathing and swallowing, he said, but it is not generally fatal. A parent who is concerned that their child is showing sudden weakness in an arm or leg should call their pediatrician's office, he said. Dr. Mark Del Beccaro, chief medical officer at Seattle Children's, sought to assure parents that it is safe to bring their children to the hospital. 'We are following our standard infection-control protocols, including putting patients with symptoms of active respiratory infections in isolation so they do not have contact with any other patients,' he said in a statement. Owens said all of the patients who came to Children's with the symptoms developed them outside of the hospital. On its website, the CDC has expressed concern about the increase of incidents in 2016. 'We know there has been an increase in these cases,' Lindquist said. 'We were all on alert.' He described the quick identification of the cluster as a success story because it was recognized and reported so quickly by doctors at Children's. The CDC said 21 cases were reported in 2014, the 1st year that national reporting of the syndrome began. Reporting of AFM is voluntary in most states, so it is difficult to interpret trends, the CDC said, but greater awareness among health-care providers may be one reason for the uptick. Owens said a group of cases occurred in the intermountain region of the Western U.S., near Colorado, in 2014, and the CDC raised awareness among physicians to begin looking for the syndrome and reporting it. The CDC recommends that children and adults be up to date on vaccinations, avoid being bitten by mosquitoes, and wash hands often.

A number of different viruses are believed to trigger AFM, including enteroviruses (e.g., poliovirus), non-polio enteroviruses (EV-D68), adenoviruses and the flaviviruses, West Nile virus and Zika virus, as well as autoimmune conditions. Without identification of the etiologic agent, one doesn't know whether the causative agent can be transmitted between humans or not. It is important to find out whether AFM is an infectious or post-infectious inflammatory process in order to guide treatment, i.e., are antiviral compounds or immunomodulation preferable as treatment?
